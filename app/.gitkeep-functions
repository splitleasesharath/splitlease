# Functions Directory Structure

This directory contains Cloudflare Pages Functions for dynamic routing.

## Current Functions:

- `view-split-lease/[id].js` - Handles dynamic listing ID routes for /view-split-lease/[id]

## Note on guest-proposals:

The `/guest-proposals` route does NOT use a Cloudflare Function because it relies on
client-side authentication to determine which user's proposals to display.
It uses the _redirects file rule instead: `/guest-proposals  /guest-proposals.html  200`
