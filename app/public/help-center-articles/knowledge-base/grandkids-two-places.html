                    <h1>Need a place by your grandkids? Here's how you can avoid maintaining two places</h1>
                </div>

                <div class="article-body">
                    <p>Ready or not, you are a <strong>grandparent</strong>! How did this happen so quickly? Wasn't it just yesterday your own children were hanging from monkey bars and running gleefully towards an ice cream truck?</p>

                    <p>Spending time with grandkids is precious but coordinating visits while they grow is easier said than done. Consider some common problems that get in the way:</p>

                    <h2>Common Challenges</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Families move</strong> (e.g., from city to city or out to the suburbs).</li>
                        <li>Staying with grandkids under one roof might be great, but it can also come with its challenges. Even when <strong>staying with family</strong> is possible, it is easy to feel you are overstaying your welcome, especially if you want to come back repeatedly.</li>
                        <li>Even if you live in a neighboring town, you might have a commute. The kids would need to be picked up and dropped off.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>Traditional Solutions (And Their Problems)</h2>

                    <h3>1. Buying Another Space Close to Your Kids</h3>
                    <p>What about <strong>buying another space close to your kids</strong>? Maybe you could make money on your new space. You'll have to consider moving costs. According to estimates provided by the American Moving & Storage Association in 2020, the average cost of an interstate move is about $8,630.</p>

                    <div class="info-box info">
                        <div class="info-box-icon">
                            <i data-feather="alert-circle"></i>
                        </div>
                        <div class="info-box-content">
                            <p><strong>What if you have multiple kids? What if the parents divorce? Where do you live?</strong></p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h3>2. Booking a Hotel</h3>
                    <p>A short term solution is to <strong>book a hotel</strong> to have a space to sleep. You'll encounter some hassles like the front desk (e.g., <strong>checking in and out</strong>) each time you make the trip and <strong>packing up in your suitcase and unpacking</strong>.</p>

                    <p>Eating healthy food might be a challenge. While you may have your own room, the rest of the hotel is being shared by many other guests who are there. Noise levels will be uncertain.</p>

                    <p>In a pinch, hotels are great at providing rooms on demand, but this is <strong>not ideal</strong> for your grandchild because they would be in an <strong>unfamiliar environment</strong>.</p>

                    <h3>3. Booking an Airbnb</h3>
                    <p>What about booking an Airbnb? That might help with kitchen space and noise level. But could you get the same Airbnb again? What would the costs be like? Would you need to pack and unpack every time? Where would you store their toys?</p>

                    <h2>The Split Lease Solution</h2>
                    <p>Split Lease is <strong>your home close to your grandkids</strong> when you need it. You pay for the nights that you need and <strong>have a home, not a hotel</strong>. Cook your own food and even have the kids over at your place.</p>

                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Benefits for Grandparents</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Your own space:</strong> Have the grandkids over without worrying about overstaying your welcome</li>
                        <li><strong>Familiar environment:</strong> Keep toys, books, and activities for the kids at your place</li>
                        <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Book for any package of repeat stays when you need to be close to loved ones</li>
                        <li><strong>Cost-effective:</strong> Pay only for the nights you need</li>
