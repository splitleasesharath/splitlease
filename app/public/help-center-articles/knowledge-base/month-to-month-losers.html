                <div class="article-body">

                    <p>Since the days of Ancient Rome, there has been a limit to the amount of time people are willing to endure on their commute. In 1994, an Italian physicist named Cesare Marchetti noted "that throughout history, humans have shown a willingness to spend roughly 60 minutes a day in transit". That's why ancient cities didn't physically expand past a reasonable walking distance. The city of Rome never exceeded three miles in diameter, about the distance a man can walk in an hour.</p>

                        <div class="info-box-icon">
                            <i data-feather="clock"></i>
                        </div>
                        <div class="info-box-content">
                            <p><strong>Marchetti's Constant</strong></p>
                            <p>This idea of maximum allowable tolerance for commutes continues in our daily lives. As transportation got faster, cities expanded. But for many of us, we are still commuting too much to be satisfied with our lives.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h2>The Problem: Commutes Make Us Unhappy</h2>
                    <p>Our weekly commutes are making us less happy, and wasting our time. For many of us, we cannot afford buying a home closer to work. What we really need is a commuter home.</p>

                    <h2>So, What is a Commuter Home?</h2>
                    <p>A commuter home is a second home which you would rent during the workweek to save time on your commute. It's a recurring rental, which can last from months to years.</p>

                    <h3>Finding a Commuter Home on Craigslist</h3>
                    <p>One way to find a commuter home is by browsing Craigslist. On this website, we can contact hosts and roommates and ask for a bespoke rental agreement - renting only Mondays through Fridays. Of course, there will be some difficulty in finding a host willing to accept this offer. But let's say you find a willing roommate who would love to have you split the rent with him, even if your rental days are unconventional.</p>

                    <h3>Example: Chris's Story</h3>
                    <p>In our example, let's say there is a consultant named Chris. Chris works in NYC but lives in TarryTown, NY. Chris finds Bryant over Craigslist who's looking for a new roommate to help pay off his lease. So for the next 6 months, Chris lives with Bryant Mondays through Fridays and pays part of the lease. Effectively, he's <em>splitting the lease</em>.</p>

                        <div class="info-box-icon">
                            <i data-feather="trending-up"></i>
                        </div>
                        <div class="info-box-content">
                            <p><strong>The Benefits</strong></p>
                            <p>Because of this arrangement, Chris shaves down his commute from one hour drive to just a 10 minute subway ride. Now, since he's spending less time doing nothing on the drive to work, he has more time to himself. More time to sleep well, cook dinner, and relax.</p>

                    <h2>A Better Solution: The Split Lease Marketplace</h2>
                    <p>This new category, commuter homes, hasn't had a formal marketplace developed for it… until now. On Split Lease, we like to think of our listings as commuter homes. We want to replicate the above scenario for all commuters willing to rent a second home in the NYC area.</p>
