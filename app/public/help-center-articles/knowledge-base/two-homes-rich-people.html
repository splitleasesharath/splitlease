                    <p>When it comes to long term rentals, two popular ways to rent are fixed term and periodic rentals.</p>

                    <h2>Understanding Fixed Term Rentals</h2>
                    <p>Under fixed term rentals, the host and the renter typically agree on a fixed number of months. Under this agreement, both parties trade away flexibility for stability. The renter commits to a certain number of months, while the host cannot easily end the lease prematurely. In return, the renter knows his housing is stable, and the host knows his cash flows are too.</p>

                    <h2>Understanding Periodic Rentals</h2>
                    <p>Periodical rentals, commonly referred to as month-to-month, are renewed on a rolling basis. Though not necessarily a month-to-month agreement, periodical rentals commonly are and thus referred to as such. Under this agreement, both parties trade away stability for flexibility. Because there is no specified end date, the host can easily end the rental. By notifying the renter 30 or 60 days ahead of time, the host can end the rental without the renter's consent.</p>

                    <div class="info-box info">
                        <div class="info-box-icon">
                            <i data-feather="info"></i>
                        </div>
                        <div class="info-box-content">
                            <p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>
                            <p>To most renters, these seem like sensible options that will cover the majority of rentals needs fairly well. But, for a subgroup of renters, there is a way to improve the rental process.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h2>A Need for a New Category: Commuter Homes</h2>
                    <p>These renters need recurring rentals with control over a higher degree of detail over which days they book. This flexstability is something that commuters need.</p>

                    <p>One problem for people who regularly commute to NYC for work is significant commute times. If a banker named Adam from Stamford, Connecticut wants to save time on his one hour commute, he can rent a room in NYC instead of spending two hrs on the train every day.</p>

                    <p>What this person needs is the ability to book a room in NYC on only the work week. What Adam would want is the ability to book a second home away from home where he can feel comfortable after a tiring day of work. He would like to have this second home over a fixed period, say over the next 6 months.</p>

                    <h2>Don't Try These Three Inconvenient Workarounds</h2>

                    <h3>1. Finding Your Own Roommate</h3>
                    <p>One way is to find a trusted roommate with a conventional lease. Adam can offer to pay only the days he needs and share the burden of the lease. The difficulty in this workaround is that Adam has to do all the legwork himself. Adam has to find, self-vet his roommate and negotiate the specifics of what the fair price of his rent is.</p>

                    <h3>2. Booking Hotels</h3>
                    <p>Another way is to rent a hotel on only the days you need. Of course, one difficulty is that you would be living in a hotel. At this hotel, you would most likely lack basic amenities such as a kitchen, dryer and washer. Another difficulty is the cost. Though there certainly are affordable hotels and hostels in NYC, booking a cheaper room might place you further away from the center of the city. For rooms at hostels, prices start at around $50. At a budget hotel, prices generally stay under $200.</p>

                    <h3>3. Airbnb Patchwork</h3>
                    <p>A third way is to book through Airbnb. A difficulty with this method is finding the dates you need on a recurring basis. Hosts book on a short term basis, and generally won't have the free dates to set up this arrangement for you. But let's say that you find a willing host. Great! Now you can feel at home staying at someone else's home. But the problem is, it isn't. As a guest, your host might not feel comfortable letting you bring your own furniture or leaving your things behind during the weekend.</p>

                    <h2>A Better Way To Rent</h2>
                    <p>With all three solutions above, there are pain points for Adam. What Adam needs is a platform that would streamline his search for a stay. Adam doesn't want to do the legwork of finding his own roommate, live in a hotel, or scramble to find willing hosts for his uncommon rental needs.</p>

                        <div class="info-box-icon">
                            <i data-feather="home"></i>

                        <div class="info-box-content">
                            <p><strong>The Split Lease Solution</strong></p>
                            <p>Yet, there is a way Adam can find his second home, save time and pay for only the days he needs. On Split Lease, we offer the flexstability that commuters need. We specifically offer both the options of fixed and periodic rentals, on only the specific days he needs.</p>

                    </div>

                    <h2>How Split Lease Works</h2>
                    <p>With fixed rentals, Adam can rent as many weeks as he wants on only the days he wants. With periodic rentals, Adam can renew his rental every two-weeks. This way he isn't tied down to any location. With Split Lease, he can even use trial nights to test a location before booking!</p>

                    <h3>Key Benefits</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Choose only the nights you need</li>
                        <li><strong>Stability:</strong> Lock in pricing for weeks or months</li>
                        <li><strong>Affordability:</strong> No need to pay for unused nights</li>
                        <li><strong>Try before you commit:</strong> Trial nights available</li>
                        <li><strong>True second home:</strong> Leave your belongings, feel at home</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Having two homes is no longer just for the wealthy. Split Lease makes multi-local living accessible to everyone who needs flexibility in their housing.</p>
