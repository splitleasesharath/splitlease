                    <h1>Commuting by car? Is it worth it in the winter?</h1>
                </div>

                <div class="article-body">
                    <p>Commuting is pretty terrible, but <strong>commuting in the winter is worse</strong> in every way. Let's first take your summer commute. You wake up and hop into your car and drive to work. Sure, there may be bumper to bumper traffic, but you have the windows down and are taking in the fresh air. It is far from ideal, but for the most part, you can get past the wasted hours because the sun is shining, you're listening to your favorite podcast, and you can think about what you'll be having for dinner.</p>

                    <h2>The Winter Commute Reality</h2>
                    <p>Now, let's take a look at your winter commute. You wake up to your alarm and bundle up before heading out to your car. You walk outside and it is <strong>totally dark</strong>, it could be 1 AM and you wouldn't be able to tell the difference from being outside.</p>

                    <p>Once at your car, you're met with about a half-inch of ice on your windshield, but this is fine. You are prepared and <strong>pull out your ice scraper</strong>, but before you know it you have spent 10 min getting every last piece of ice and now you are really in a hurry.</p>

                    <div class="info-box info">
                        <div class="info-box-icon">
                            <i data-feather="thermometer"></i>

                        <div class="info-box-content">
                            <p><strong>The Cold Reality</strong></p>
                            <p>You start to drive as you wait for your car to warm up from <strong>sub-zero temperatures</strong>. Then, just like every other morning, you are met with the dreaded bumper to bumper traffic. However, unlike the summer, you have to focus on not sliding and slipping around as you stop and go and stop and go and stop.</p>

                    <h2>A Complex NYC Commute Example</h2>
                    <p>Since many of us work in NYC, our commute will be a little more complicated than just a car ride. Our winter experience isn't as comfortable as driving our heated car from point A to point B.</p>

                    <p>Let's take a hypothetical commute in the winter from NJ to NYC. Since finding parking in NYC is a hassle and incredibly expensive, Catherine lives in Summit, NJ. She'll begin her day by:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Driving from Summit to Newark, NJ</strong> (~30 minutes)</li>
                        <li><strong>Parking and catching the Newark PATH</strong> to World Trade Center (departs every 5 minutes)</li>
                        <li><strong>Riding the train</strong> (~22 minutes)</li>
                        <li><strong>Taking the subway</strong> to the financial district (~5 minutes)</li>
                        <li><strong>Walking to her office</strong> from the subway</li>
                    </ol>

                    <div class="info-box info">
                        <div class="info-box-icon">
                            <i data-feather="clock"></i>
                        </div>
                        <div class="info-box-content">
                            <p><strong>This is around two hours wasted every day</strong> for a full two-way commute during the <strong>freezing winter</strong>. All this effort to be freezing cold and miserable, 5 days a week. You deserve better!</p>
