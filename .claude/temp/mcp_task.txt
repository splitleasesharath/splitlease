TASK: Query Supabase dev database to investigate proposal data for host rodtesthost@test.com

CONTEXT:

- Leo's expected ID: 1697550315775x613621430341750000
- Host email: rodtesthost@test.com

MCP SERVER TO USE: supabase-dev

OPERATIONS REQUIRED:

1. Query user table to find host ID:
   SELECT id, email, "Name" FROM "user" WHERE email = 'rodtesthost@test.com'

2. Using the host ID from step 1, query listing table:
   SELECT id, "Name", Host FROM listing WHERE Host = '<host_id_from_step_1>'

3. Using listing IDs from step 2, query proposal table:
   SELECT id, Guest, Listing, "Created Date", Status FROM proposal WHERE Listing IN (<listing_ids_from_step_2>)

4. For each proposal found, show:
   - Proposal ID
   - Guest ID (the actual value)
   - Listing ID
   - Any other relevant fields

GOAL: Determine if proposals exist, what Guest IDs they contain, and whether any match Leo's ID (1697550315775x613621430341750000)

Please execute these queries and return the complete results.
