I want you to look at the tool that we added that checks all the files that were updated or removed or added, that were committed locally and have not been pushed to remote/origin, and then check against for these files to confirm that all the changes made has corresponding fixes applied. That is all dependcies built on these barrel files are now sorted. Completion is after you've confirm that no dependants are abandoned
