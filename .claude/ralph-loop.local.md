I want you to refactor all files and scripts in the current project to be in line with the principles outlined in @/c:/Users/Split Lease/Documents/Split Lease/.claude/Documentation/Architecture/The Functional Programming Bible A Practical Reference for Writing Pure, Functional Code.md  
Use the typescript-lsp plugin when necessary to your aid. I want you to be thorough and mark each script as DONE after refactoring the said script, in this directory to be inline with the principles of functional programming as outlined above. Do not stop until all files are factored and marked as refactored DONE. I want each and every change logged, every opportunity found for changes logges into C:\Users\Split Lease\Documents\Split Lease\ralph-changelog
