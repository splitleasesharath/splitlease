# Task: Test Routing Behavior on splitlease.app

## Objective
Test the routing behavior on splitlease.app to identify non-deterministic routing issues with the view-split-lease page.

## Context
The user is experiencing non-deterministic routing behavior where clicking on listing cards from the search page doesn't consistently navigate to the correct listing detail page. We need to systematically test multiple listings to understand the pattern.

## Required Steps

### Setup
1. Open browser using Playwright MCP
2. Navigate to https://splitlease.app/search.html

### Test Sequence
For each of the first FOUR listing cards on the search page:

1. **Before Click:**
   - Take a snapshot to identify the listing
   - Extract the href attribute of the listing card link
   - Note any data attributes (like data-listing-id if present)

2. **Click and Observe:**
   - Click on the listing card
   - Wait for navigation to complete
   - Take a snapshot of the resulting page

3. **Record Results:**
   - Final URL after navigation
   - Whether the listing page loaded properly or showed errors
   - Check console for errors
   - Check network requests for failed requests or redirects
   - Compare expected URL (from href) vs actual URL

4. **Navigate Back:**
   - Go back to https://splitlease.app/search.html
   - Wait for page to reload completely
   - Verify listings are still visible

### Data to Collect
For each listing test (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th):
- **Pre-click href**: The href attribute before clicking
- **Expected behavior**: Should navigate to that href
- **Actual URL**: The URL after navigation completes
- **Page state**: Does it show the listing details, blank page, or redirect?
- **Console errors**: Any JavaScript errors
- **Network issues**: Failed requests, unexpected redirects

### Expected Deliverables
A structured report showing:
1. Summary of routing behavior across all 4 listings
2. Whether behavior is consistent or inconsistent
3. Specific URLs and outcomes for each test
4. Console errors and network issues observed
5. Screenshots/snapshots showing the actual behavior
6. Analysis of what might be causing the non-deterministic behavior

### Important Notes
- Use proper wait strategies (wait for listings to appear before clicking)
- Allow sufficient time for navigation and rendering
- Close browser properly when done
- If authentication or cookies are needed, handle gracefully
