## Task: Test account-profile page routing with Playwright MCP

### Context
User has updated vite.config.js and needs to verify the account-profile page routing works correctly.

### Required Steps
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5177/account-profile
2. Take a screenshot of what loads
3. Check browser console for errors (especially module import errors)
4. Take a snapshot to see DOM structure
5. Test http://localhost:5177/account-profile.html to ensure both routes work
6. Check if page is redirecting (since there's no auth set up yet)

### Expected Deliverables
- Screenshots of what renders on both URLs
- Any console errors found
- Assessment of whether routing is working correctly
- What happens when page loads (redirect, error, or partial render)

### Tools to Use
- Playwright MCP for browser automation
- Browser navigation, screenshots, console monitoring, and snapshots
- Ensure proper cleanup (close browser when done)
