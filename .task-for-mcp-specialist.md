# Task: Test Guest Proposals Page with Playwright MCP

## Context
Testing the authentication flow for the guest-proposals page running locally at http://localhost:5176/guest-proposals

## Objective
Use Playwright MCP to:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5176/guest-proposals
2. Take a snapshot to see what's displayed on the page
3. Check the browser console for any error messages or auth-related logs
4. Report back findings

## Expected Behaviors
The page should exhibit one of these behaviors:
- Show "User is not logged in" message if no auth
- Redirect to home page (/)
- Show the proposals page if somehow auth is valid

## Focus
Understanding what's happening with the authentication flow - look for:
- Auth state checks
- Redirect logic
- Error messages
- Console logs related to authentication
- Any Supabase auth-related activity

## Deliverables
1. Snapshot/screenshot of what the page displays
2. Console logs (especially errors and auth-related messages)
3. Summary of the authentication flow behavior observed
4. Any redirect behavior noted
