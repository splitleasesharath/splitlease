## Task: Build Validation with Troubleshooting

Run `bun run build` from the `app/` directory and ensure it passes.

### Modified Files (for context):


### Instructions:

1. **Run the build**: Execute `bun run build` from the `app/` directory
2. **Monitor the outcome**: Wait for the build to complete
3. **On SUCCESS**: Output "COMPLETED" to end the loop
4. **On FAILURE**:
   - Analyze the error output (lint errors, type errors, vite errors)
   - Identify the root cause
   - Fix the issues in the affected files
   - Re-run `bun run build`
5. **Repeat** until build succeeds or max iterations reached

### Common Build Issues:
- Import path errors (file doesn't exist, wrong relative path)
- Missing exports (function was deleted but still imported elsewhere)
- Type errors from refactoring changes
- Circular dependencies
- Syntax errors from incomplete edits

### Working Directories:
- Project root: C:\Users\Split Lease\Documents\Split Lease
- App directory: C:\Users\Split Lease\Documents\Split Lease\app

### Completion Criteria:
When `bun run build` exits with code 0, output exactly:
```
COMPLETED
```

This signals successful build validation. Begin now.
