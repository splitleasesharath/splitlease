Now I have enough information to compile my findings. Let me create a comprehensive analysis report:\n\n## COMPREHENSIVE CODE AUDIT: app/src/logic/\n\nBased on my thorough scan of all files in `app/src/logic`, I've identified the following issues:\n\n---\n\n### **CRITICAL ISSUES**\n\n#### **1. Code Duplication: Duplicate Proposal Processors**\n\n**Files:**\n- `app/src/logic/processors/proposal/processProposalData.js` (Simple version)\n- `app/src/logic/processors/proposals/processProposalData.js` (Extended version with helpers)\n\n**Issue:** Two separate implementations of proposal data processing exist with overlapping functionality but different structures. This violates DRY principle and creates maintenance burden.\n\n**Line Numbers:**\n- `/proposal/processProposalData.js`: Lines 1-148\n- `/proposals/processProposalData.js`: Lines 1-330\n\n**Current Code:**\nBoth functions have the same name but different signatures and return structures. The index.js exports both:\n```javascript\n// processors/index.js lines 25, 28-39\nexport { processProposalData } from './proposal/processProposalData.js'\nexport { processProposalData as processFullProposalData, ... } from './proposals/processProposalData.js'\n```\n\n**Affected Pages:** Any page importing from `islands/pages/proposals/` or proposal modals that use `processProposalData`\n\n**Suggested Refactoring:**\n- Consolidate both implementations into a single `processProposalData` function with optional parameters\n- Keep the simpler version as a wrapper for backward compatibility\n- Update all imports to use unified function\n- Remove alias exports (`processFullProposalData`, etc.)\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Missing Documentation Annotations in getNextOccurrenceOfDay.js**\n\n**File:** `app/src/logic/calculators/scheduling/getNextOccurrenceOfDay.js`\n\n**Issue:** JSDoc parameters are corrupted with file path garbage. Lines 4-5 reference `.claude\\plans\\Deprecated\\Context\\Option Sets\\ZEP - Curation Parameters(OS).md` instead of proper @param annotations.\n\n**Line Numbers:** Lines 4-5\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n* @.claude\\plans\\Deprecated\\Context\\Option Sets\\ZEP - Curation Parameters(OS).md {Date} startDate - The date to start searching from.\n* @.claude\\plans\\Deprecated\\Context\\Option Sets\\ZEP - Curation Parameters(OS).md {number} targetDayOfWeek - Day index (0-6, where 0=Sunday).\n```\n\n**Suggested Refactoring:**\n```javascript\n* @param {Date} startDate - The date to start searching from.\n* @param {number} targetDayOfWeek - Day index (0-6, where 0=Sunday).\n```\n\n**Affected Pages:** Any page using `calculateNextAvailableCheckIn` or scheduling workflows\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Missing Strict Validation in isContiguousSelection.js**\n\n**File:** `app/src/logic/calculators/scheduling/isContiguousSelection.js`\n\n**Issue:** Function has NO input validation, silently returns false for invalid inputs instead of throwing errors. Violates \"No Fallback\" principle documented in index.js.\n\n**Line Numbers:** Lines 8-30\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\nexport function isContiguousSelection(selectedDays) {\n  if (!selectedDays || selectedDays.length === 0) return false;  // ❌ No error\n  if (selectedDays.length === 1) return true;\n  if (selectedDays.length >= 6) return true;\n  // ... no validation of day indices (should be 0-6)\n}\n```\n\n**Suggested Refactoring:**\nShould match strict pattern in `isScheduleContiguous.js`:\n```javascript\nexport function isContiguousSelection(selectedDays) {\n  if (!Array.isArray(selectedDays)) {\n    throw new Error(`isContiguousSelection: selectedDays must be an array, got ${typeof selectedDays}`)\n  }\n  if (selectedDays.length === 0) {\n    throw new Error('isContiguousSelection: selectedDays cannot be empty')\n  }\n  for (const day of selectedDays) {\n    if (typeof day !== 'number' || isNaN(day) || day < 0 || day > 6) {\n      throw new Error(`isContiguousSelection: Invalid day index ${day}, must be 0-6`)\n    }\n  }\n  // ... rest of logic\n}\n```\n\n**Affected Pages:** Search pages, booking flows using day selection\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Inconsistent Validation Across Similar Functions**\n\n**Files with inconsistent patterns:**\n\n| Function | File | Issue |\n|----------|------|-------|\n| `isContiguousSelection` | `calculators/scheduling/isContiguousSelection.js` | **No validation** - returns false silently |\n| `isScheduleContiguous` | `rules/scheduling/isScheduleContiguous.js` | **Full validation** - throws errors |\n| `getNextOccurrenceOfDay` | `calculators/scheduling/getNextOccurrenceOfDay.js` | **No validation** at all |\n| `calculateCheckInOutDays` | `calculators/scheduling/calculateCheckInOutDays.js` | **Full validation** - throws errors |\n\n**Impact:** Inconsistent error handling makes code behavior unpredictable.\n\n**Suggested Refactoring:** Standardize all three scheduling calculators to match the strict validation pattern in `calculateCheckInOutDays`.\n\n---\n\n### **MODERATE ISSUES**\n\n#### **5.

Code Duplication: Duplicate Proposal Processors**\n\n**Files:**\n- `app/src/logic/processors/proposal/processProposalData.js` (Simple version)\n- `app/src/logic/processors/proposals/processProposalData.js` (Extended version with helpers)\n\n**Issue:** Two separate implementations of proposal data processing exist with overlapping functionality but different structures. This violates DRY principle and creates maintenance burden.\n\n**Line Numbers:**\n- `/proposal/processProposalData.js`: Lines 1-148\n- `/proposals/processProposalData.js`: Lines 1-330\n\n**Current Code:**\nBoth functions have the same name but different signatures and return structures. The index.js exports both:\n```javascript\n// processors/index.js lines 25, 28-39\nexport { processProposalData } from './proposal/processProposalData.js'\nexport { processProposalData as processFullProposalData, ... } from './proposals/processProposalData.js'\n```\n\n**Affected Pages:** Any page importing from `islands/pages/proposals/` or proposal modals that use `processProposalData`\n\n**Suggested Refactoring:**\n- Consolidate both implementations into a single `processProposalData` function with optional parameters\n- Keep the simpler version as a wrapper for backward compatibility\n- Update all imports to use unified function\n- Remove alias exports (`processFullProposalData`, etc.)\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Missing Documentation Annotations in getNextOccurrenceOfDay.js**\n\n**File:** `app/src/logic/calculators/scheduling/getNextOccurrenceOfDay.js`\n\n**Issue:** JSDoc parameters are corrupted with file path garbage. Lines 4-5 reference `.claude\\plans\\Deprecated\\Context\\Option Sets\\ZEP - Curation Parameters(OS).md` instead of proper @param annotations.\n\n**Line Numbers:** Lines 4-5\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n* @.claude\\plans\\Deprecated\\Context\\Option Sets\\ZEP - Curation Parameters(OS).md {Date} startDate - The date to start searching from.\n* @.claude\\plans\\Deprecated\\Context\\Option Sets\\ZEP - Curation Parameters(OS).md {number} targetDayOfWeek - Day index (0-6, where 0=Sunday).\n```\n\n**Suggested Refactoring:**\n```javascript\n* @param {Date} startDate - The date to start searching from.\n* @param {number} targetDayOfWeek - Day index (0-6, where 0=Sunday).\n```\n\n**Affected Pages:** Any page using `calculateNextAvailableCheckIn` or scheduling workflows\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Missing Strict Validation in isContiguousSelection.js**\n\n**File:** `app/src/logic/calculators/scheduling/isContiguousSelection.js`\n\n**Issue:** Function has NO input validation, silently returns false for invalid inputs instead of throwing errors. Violates \"No Fallback\" principle documented in index.js.\n\n**Line Numbers:** Lines 8-30\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\nexport function isContiguousSelection(selectedDays) {\n  if (!selectedDays || selectedDays.length === 0) return false;  // ❌ No error\n  if (selectedDays.length === 1) return true;\n  if (selectedDays.length >= 6) return true;\n  // ... no validation of day indices (should be 0-6)\n}\n```\n\n**Suggested Refactoring:**\nShould match strict pattern in `isScheduleContiguous.js`:\n```javascript\nexport function isContiguousSelection(selectedDays) {\n  if (!Array.isArray(selectedDays)) {\n    throw new Error(`isContiguousSelection: selectedDays must be an array, got ${typeof selectedDays}`)\n  }\n  if (selectedDays.length === 0) {\n    throw new Error('isContiguousSelection: selectedDays cannot be empty')\n  }\n  for (const day of selectedDays) {\n    if (typeof day !== 'number' || isNaN(day) || day < 0 || day > 6) {\n      throw new Error(`isContiguousSelection: Invalid day index ${day}, must be 0-6`)\n    }\n  }\n  // ... rest of logic\n}\n```\n\n**Affected Pages:** Search pages, booking flows using day selection\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Inconsistent Validation Across Similar Functions**\n\n**Files with inconsistent patterns:**\n\n| Function | File | Issue |\n|----------|------|-------|\n| `isContiguousSelection` | `calculators/scheduling/isContiguousSelection.js` | **No validation** - returns false silently |\n| `isScheduleContiguous` | `rules/scheduling/isScheduleContiguous.js` | **Full validation** - throws errors |\n| `getNextOccurrenceOfDay` | `calculators/scheduling/getNextOccurrenceOfDay.js` | **No validation** at all |\n| `calculateCheckInOutDays` | `calculators/scheduling/calculateCheckInOutDays.js` | **Full validation** - throws errors |\n\n**Impact:** Inconsistent error handling makes code behavior unpredictable.\n\n**Suggested Refactoring:** Standardize all three scheduling calculators to match the strict validation pattern in `calculateCheckInOutDays`.\n\n---\n\n### **MODERATE ISSUES**\n\n#### **5.

Inefficient Array Operations in isScheduleContiguous.js**\n\n**File:** `app/src/logic/rules/scheduling/isScheduleContiguous.js`\n\n**Issue:** Line 94-97 creates array unnecessarily using `Array.from` when simpler approach exists.\n\n**Line Numbers:** Lines 94-97\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\nconst expectedNotSelected = Array.from(\n  { length: maxNotSelected - minNotSelected + 1 },\n  (_, i) => minNotSelected + i\n)\n```\n\n**Suggested Refactoring:**\n```javascript\n// Simple range check instead of creating array\nconst isContiguousRange = notSelectedDays.every(\n  (day, i) => day === minNotSelected + i\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **TESTING/MAINTAINABILITY ISSUES**\n\n#### **12. useProposalButtonStates Hook Violates Rule Architecture**\n\n**File:** `app/src/logic/rules/proposals/useProposalButtonStates.js`\n\n**Issue:** This is a React hook in the Logic Core, violating architecture principle stated in `index.js` line 12: \"No React dependencies\"\n\n**Line Numbers:** Lines 1, 11, 25-26\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\nimport { useMemo } from 'react';  // ❌ React import in logic core\n\nexport function useProposalButtonStates({ proposal, virtualMeeting, guest, listing, currentUserId }) {\n  return useMemo(() => {  // ❌ React hook\n    // ...\n  }, [proposal, virtualMeeting, guest, listing, currentUserId]);\n}\n```\n\n**Affected Pages:** All pages using `useProposalButtonStates` (proposal cards, details)\n\n**Suggested Refactoring:** Move to `islands/` layer or refactor to pure function:\n```javascript\n// In logic/rules/proposals/proposalButtonStates.js\nexport function getProposalButtonStates({ proposal, virtualMeeting, guest, listing, currentUserId }) {\n  // Pure logic, no React\n  const rawStatus = proposal.Status || proposal.status\n  // ... return button states object\n}\n\n// In islands/useProposalButtonStates.js\nimport { useMemo } from 'react'\nimport { getProposalButtonStates } from '../../logic/rules/proposals/proposalButtonStates.js'\n\nexport function useProposalButtonStates(params) {\n  return useMemo(() => getProposalButtonStates(params), [params])\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### **SUMMARY TABLE**\n\n| Priority | Issue | File(s) | Type | Lines |\n|----------|-------|---------|------|-------|\n| 🔴 CRITICAL | Duplicate Proposal Processors | `processor/proposal/*.js` + `processors/proposals/*.js` | Duplication | 1-148, 1-330 |\n| 🔴 CRITICAL | Corrupted JSDoc in getNextOccurrenceOfDay | `calculators/scheduling/getNextOccurrenceOfDay.js` | Documentation | 4-5 |\n| 🔴 CRITICAL | Missing Validation in isContiguousSelection | `calculators/scheduling/isContiguousSelection.js` | Validation | 8-30 |\n| 🟠 MODERATE | Inconsistent Validation Across Functions | Multiple scheduling files | Consistency | Various |\n| 🟠 MODERATE | Mutable State in extractListingCoordinates | `processors/listing/extractListingCoordinates.js` | FP Violation | 39-40, 54, 67 |\n| 🟠 MODERATE | Inconsistent Error Handling | `processors/proposal/*.js` + `processors/proposals/*.js` | Error Handling | Multiple |\n| 🟠 MODERATE | Silent Error Swallowing | `rules/search/hasListingPhotos.js` | Error Handling | 38-40 |\n| 🟡 MODERATE | Complex Wrap-Around Logic | `rules/scheduling/isScheduleContiguous.js` | Maintainability | 75-104 |\n| 🟡 MODERATE | Missing Validation in getNextOccurrenceOfDay | `calculators/scheduling/getNextOccurrenceOfDay.js` | Validation | 8-16 |\n| 🟡 MODERATE | Redundant Name Fallback Logic | `processors/user/processUserData.js` | Complexity | 41-60 |\n| 🟡 MODERATE | Inefficient Array Operations | `rules/scheduling/isScheduleContiguous.js` | Performance | 94-97 |\n| 🔵 ARCHITECTURAL | React Hook in Logic Core | `rules/proposals/useProposalButtonStates.js` | Architecture | 1, 11, 25-26 |\n\n---\n\n**Most Affected Pages:**\n1.
