Do not output false promises to escape the loop, even if you think you're stuck or should exit for other reasons. The loop is designed to continue until genuine completion.\r\n"

Lines 16 and 352-358 both import from `../../constants/proposalStatuses.js`. This is a JavaScript syntax error that could cause runtime failures or bundler issues.\n**Affected Pages:** /guest-proposals, /view-split-lease, /create-suggested-proposal\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n// Line 16\nimport { PROPOSAL_STATUSES, isTerminalStatus, isCompletedStatus, getActionsForStatus } from '../../constants/proposalStatuses.js';\n\n// Lines 351-358 (DUPLICATE - violates JS module rules)\n// Import from constants instead of duplicating\nimport {\n  PROPOSAL_STATUSES,\n  isTerminalStatus,\n  isCompletedStatus,\n  getActionsForStatus,\n  isSuggestedProposal  // Add this import\n} from '../../constants/proposalStatuses.js';\n\n// Remove duplicate isSLSuggestedProposal definition\n// Re-export for backward compatibility if needed:\nexport { isSuggestedProposal as isSLSuggestedProposal };\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// Line 16 - Single, consolidated import\nimport {\n  PROPOSAL_STATUSES,\n  isTerminalStatus,\n  isCompletedStatus,\n  getActionsForStatus,\n  isSuggestedProposal\n} from '../../constants/proposalStatuses.js';\n\n// Remove lines 351-362 entirely\n\n// At the end of the file, add re-export for backward compatibility:\nexport { isSuggestedProposal as isSLSuggestedProposal };\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Run `bun run build` to verify no syntax errors\n- [ ] Check that `/guest-proposals` page loads without errors\n- [ ] Verify `isSLSuggestedProposal` is still accessible from existing imports\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 2: Duplicate useProposalButtonStates Hook and proposalButtonRules\n**Files:** `app/src/logic/rules/proposals/useProposalButtonStates.js`, `app/src/logic/rules/proposals/proposalButtonRules.js`\n**Line:** Entire files\n**Issue:** These two files contain nearly IDENTICAL implementations of the same button state logic. `useProposalButtonStates.js` (148 lines) is a React hook that wraps `useMemo`, while `proposalButtonRules.js` (129 lines) is a pure function `computeProposalButtonStates`. The logic inside both is 95% identical. This violates DRY and creates maintenance burden.\n**Affected Pages:** /guest-proposals\n\n**Current Code (useProposalButtonStates.js):**\n```javascript\nimport { useMemo } from 'react';\nimport { getStatusConfig, PROPOSAL_STATUS } from '../../../config/proposalStatusConfig.js';\n\nexport function useProposalButtonStates({ proposal, virtualMeeting, guest, listing, currentUserId }) {\n  return useMemo(() => {\n    if (!proposal) {\n      return {\n        virtualMeeting: { visible: false },\n        guestAction1: { visible: false },\n        guestAction2: { visible: false },\n        cancelProposal: { visible: false },\n      };\n    }\n    // ... 120+ lines of button logic\n  }, [proposal, virtualMeeting, guest, listing, currentUserId]);\n}\n```\n\n**Current Code (proposalButtonRules.js):**\n```javascript\nimport { getStatusConfig, PROPOSAL_STATUS } from '../../../config/proposalStatusConfig.js';\n\nexport function computeProposalButtonStates({ proposal, virtualMeeting, guest, listing, currentUserId }) {\n  if (!proposal) {\n    return {\n      virtualMeeting: { visible: false },\n      guestAction1: { visible: false },\n      guestAction2: { visible: false },\n      cancelProposal: { visible: false },\n    };\n  }\n  // ... 120+ lines of identical button logic\n}\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// proposalButtonRules.js - Keep only the pure function\nimport { getStatusConfig, PROPOSAL_STATUS } from '../../../config/proposalStatusConfig.js';\n\n/**\n * Compute button states for a proposal card (pure function).\n * @param {object} params - Named parameters\n * @param {object} params.proposal - The proposal object\n * @param {object} params.virtualMeeting - Virtual meeting data\n * @param {object} params.guest - Guest user object\n * @param {object} params.listing - Listing object\n * @param {string} params.currentUserId - Current user's ID\n * @returns {object} Button states\n */\nexport function computeProposalButtonStates({ proposal, virtualMeeting, guest, listing, currentUserId }) {\n  // ... single implementation of button logic\n}\n\n// useProposalButtonStates.js - Thin wrapper that calls the pure function\nimport { useMemo } from 'react';\nimport { computeProposalButtonStates } from './proposalButtonRules.js';\n\n/**\n * React hook wrapper for proposal button states with memoization.\n */\nexport function useProposalButtonStates(params) {\n  return useMemo(\n    () => computeProposalButtonStates(params),\n    [params.proposal, params.virtualMeeting, params.guest, params.listing, params.currentUserId]\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Verify `app/src/hooks/useProposalButtonStates.js` still works\n- [ ] Test ProposalCard button visibility on `/guest-proposals`\n- [ ] Test ExpandableProposalCard button visibility\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 3: Architecture Violation - React Hook in Rules Layer\n**File:** `app/src/logic/rules/proposals/useProposalButtonStates.js`\n**Line:** 1-148\n**Issue:** This file is a React hook (`useMemo` import on line 11) placed in the `rules/` layer. The four-layer architecture specifies that rules should be pure boolean predicates with NO React dependencies. React hooks belong in `app/src/hooks/`. This violates the architecture and makes the rules layer impure.\n**Affected Pages:** /guest-proposals\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n// File location: app/src/logic/rules/proposals/useProposalButtonStates.js\nimport { useMemo } from 'react';  // React import in rules layer!\nimport { getStatusConfig, PROPOSAL_STATUS } from '../../../config/proposalStatusConfig.js';\n\nexport function useProposalButtonStates({ proposal, virtualMeeting, guest, listing, currentUserId }) {\n  return useMemo(() => {\n    // ...\n  }, [proposal, virtualMeeting, guest, listing, currentUserId]);\n}\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// MOVE file to: app/src/hooks/useProposalButtonStates.js\n// (Note: A wrapper already exists at this location - consolidate them)\n\n// Keep pure logic in: app/src/logic/rules/proposals/proposalButtonRules.js\n// as computeProposalButtonStates (pure function, no React)\n\n// The existing app/src/hooks/useProposalButtonStates.js already does this correctly:\nimport { computeProposalButtonStates } from '../logic/rules/proposals/proposalButtonRules.js';\n// Just delete the rules layer file after consolidation\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Delete `app/src/logic/rules/proposals/useProposalButtonStates.js`\n- [ ] Verify `app/src/hooks/useProposalButtonStates.js` is used everywhere\n- [ ] Run build to ensure no broken imports\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 4: Duplicate cancelProposalWorkflow Implementations\n**Files:** `app/src/logic/workflows/booking/cancelProposalWorkflow.js`, `app/src/logic/workflows/proposals/cancelProposalWorkflow.js`\n**Line:** Entire files\n**Issue:** Two files with IDENTICAL names implementing the same cancellation workflow. The `booking/` version (144 lines) uses dependency injection pattern for `canCancelProposal`, while the `proposals/` version (176 lines) imports it directly. Both update the same `proposal` table with the same status.

The four-layer architecture specifies that rules should be pure boolean predicates with NO React dependencies. React hooks belong in `app/src/hooks/`. This violates the architecture and makes the rules layer impure.\n**Affected Pages:** /guest-proposals\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n// File location: app/src/logic/rules/proposals/useProposalButtonStates.js\nimport { useMemo } from 'react';  // React import in rules layer!\nimport { getStatusConfig, PROPOSAL_STATUS } from '../../../config/proposalStatusConfig.js';\n\nexport function useProposalButtonStates({ proposal, virtualMeeting, guest, listing, currentUserId }) {\n  return useMemo(() => {\n    // ...\n  }, [proposal, virtualMeeting, guest, listing, currentUserId]);\n}\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// MOVE file to: app/src/hooks/useProposalButtonStates.js\n// (Note: A wrapper already exists at this location - consolidate them)\n\n// Keep pure logic in: app/src/logic/rules/proposals/proposalButtonRules.js\n// as computeProposalButtonStates (pure function, no React)\n\n// The existing app/src/hooks/useProposalButtonStates.js already does this correctly:\nimport { computeProposalButtonStates } from '../logic/rules/proposals/proposalButtonRules.js';\n// Just delete the rules layer file after consolidation\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Delete `app/src/logic/rules/proposals/useProposalButtonStates.js`\n- [ ] Verify `app/src/hooks/useProposalButtonStates.js` is used everywhere\n- [ ] Run build to ensure no broken imports\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 4: Duplicate cancelProposalWorkflow Implementations\n**Files:** `app/src/logic/workflows/booking/cancelProposalWorkflow.js`, `app/src/logic/workflows/proposals/cancelProposalWorkflow.js`\n**Line:** Entire files\n**Issue:** Two files with IDENTICAL names implementing the same cancellation workflow. The `booking/` version (144 lines) uses dependency injection pattern for `canCancelProposal`, while the `proposals/` version (176 lines) imports it directly. Both update the same `proposal` table with the same status. This creates confusion and maintenance burden.\n**Affected Pages:** /guest-proposals, /view-split-lease\n\n**Current Code (workflows/booking/cancelProposalWorkflow.js):**\n```javascript\nimport { PROPOSAL_STATUSES } from '../../constants/proposalStatuses.js'\n\nexport async function cancelProposalWorkflow({\n  supabase,\n  proposal,\n  source = 'main',\n  canCancelProposal  // Dependency injection\n}) {\n  // Uses passed-in canCancelProposal function\n  const canCancel = canCancelProposal({\n    proposalStatus: proposal.status,\n    deleted: proposal.deleted\n  })\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n**Current Code (workflows/proposals/cancelProposalWorkflow.js):**\n```javascript\nimport { supabase } from '../../../lib/supabase.js';\nimport { canCancelProposal, requiresSpecialCancellationConfirmation } from '../../rules/proposals/proposalRules.js';\nimport { PROPOSAL_STATUSES } from '../../constants/proposalStatuses.js';\n\nexport function determineCancellationCondition(proposal) { /* ... */ }\nexport async function executeCancelProposal(proposalId, reason = null) { /* ... */ }\nexport async function cancelProposalFromCompareTerms(proposalId, reason = 'Counteroffer declined') { /* ... */ }\nexport async function executeDeleteProposal(proposalId) { /* ... */ }\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// KEEP: app/src/logic/workflows/proposals/cancelProposalWorkflow.js\n// (More comprehensive with determineCancellationCondition, soft-delete, etc.)\n\n// DEPRECATE: app/src/logic/workflows/booking/cancelProposalWorkflow.js\n// Update any imports from booking/ to proposals/\n\n// The proposals/ version has:\n// - determineCancellationCondition() - business logic\n// - executeCancelProposal() - actual DB update\n// - cancelProposalFromCompareTerms() - modal-specific variant\n// - executeDeleteProposal() - soft delete\n\n// These are used by:\n// - ProposalCard.jsx (executeDeleteProposal)\n// - ExpandableProposalCard.jsx (executeDeleteProposal)\n// - GuestEditingProposalModal.jsx (executeCancelProposal)\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Search for imports from `workflows/booking/cancelProposalWorkflow`\n- [ ] Update to use `workflows/proposals/cancelProposalWorkflow`\n- [ ] Delete `workflows/booking/cancelProposalWorkflow.js`\n- [ ] Test cancel flow on ProposalCard\n- [ ] Test cancel flow on GuestEditingProposalModal\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 5: Duplicate processProposalData Implementations\n**Files:** `app/src/logic/processors/proposal/processProposalData.js`, `app/src/logic/processors/proposals/processProposalData.js`\n**Line:** Entire files\n**Issue:** Two directories (`proposal/` singular vs `proposals/` plural) with DIFFERENT implementations of the same function name. The `proposal/` version (149 lines) has a cleaner structure with `currentTerms`/`originalTerms`, while `proposals/` (330 lines) has more functions including `formatPrice`, `formatDate`, `getEffectiveTerms`.

The `@param` annotation contains a file path reference instead of proper parameter documentation: `@.claude\\plans\\Deprecated\\Context\\Option Sets\\ZEP - Curation Parameters(OS).md {number[]} selectedDays`. This is likely a copy-paste error that broke the JSDoc.\n**Affected Pages:** /search, /create-split-lease\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n/**\n * Check if selected days form a contiguous block.\n * Handles week wrap-around cases (e.g., Fri-Mon).\n *\n * @.claude\\plans\\Deprecated\\Context\\Option Sets\\ZEP - Curation Parameters(OS).md {number[]} selectedDays - Array of day indices (0-6).\n * @returns {boolean} True if days are contiguous.\n */\nexport function isContiguousSelection(selectedDays) {\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n/**\n * Check if selected days form a contiguous block.\n * Handles week wrap-around cases (e.g., Fri-Mon).\n *\n * @param {number[]} selectedDays - Array of day indices (0-6, where 0=Sunday).\n * @returns {boolean} True if days are contiguous.\n *\n * @example\n * isContiguousSelection([1, 2, 3, 4]) // => true (Mon-Thu)\n * isContiguousSelection([5, 6, 0, 1]) // => true (Fri-Mon, wraps around)\n * isContiguousSelection([1, 3, 5])    // => false (non-contiguous)\n */\nexport function isContiguousSelection(selectedDays) {\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Run `bun run lint` to verify JSDoc is valid\n- [ ] Verify function still works correctly with day selection on /search\n\n~~~~~\n\n## PAGE GROUP: /view-split-lease (Chunks: 7)\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 7: Unused Import in counterofferWorkflow\n**File:** `app/src/logic/workflows/proposals/counterofferWorkflow.js`\n**Line:** 19\n**Issue:** The `hasReviewableCounteroffer` function is imported but never used in the file. The workflow directly checks `proposal['counter offer happened']` instead of using the rule function. This is inconsistent with the four-layer architecture where workflows should use rules, not raw field checks.\n**Affected Pages:** /view-split-lease, /guest-proposals\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\nimport { supabase } from '../../../lib/supabase.js';\nimport { hasReviewableCounteroffer } from '../../rules/proposals/proposalRules.js';  // Imported but unused\nimport { PROPOSAL_STATUSES } from '../../constants/proposalStatuses.js';\n\nexport async function acceptCounteroffer(proposalId) {\n  // ...\n  if (!proposal['counter offer happened']) {  // Raw field check instead of using rule\n    throw new Error('Proposal does not have a counteroffer to accept');\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\nimport { supabase } from '../../../lib/supabase.js';\nimport { hasReviewableCounteroffer } from '../../rules/proposals/proposalRules.js';\nimport { PROPOSAL_STATUSES } from '../../constants/proposalStatuses.js';\n\nexport async function acceptCounteroffer(proposalId) {\n  // ...\n  // Use the rule function for consistency\n  if (!hasReviewableCounteroffer(proposal)) {\n    throw new Error('Proposal does not have a reviewable counteroffer');\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Test accept counteroffer flow on /view-split-lease\n- [ ] Verify error message displays correctly when no counteroffer exists\n\n~~~~~\n\n## PAGE GROUP: /host-proposals (Chunks: 8)\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 8: Duplicate User Processing Functions\n**File:** `app/src/logic/processors/proposals/processProposalData.js`\n**Line:** 18-39, 81-99\n**Issue:** The file contains `processUserData` and `processHostData` functions that are nearly identical (same field mappings, same structure). Additionally, `processUserData` already exists in `processors/user/processUserData.js` with a more robust implementation. This violates DRY.\n**Affected Pages:** /host-proposals, /guest-proposals\n\n**Current Code (in processors/proposals/processProposalData.js):**\n```javascript\nexport function processUserData(rawUser) {\n  if (!rawUser) { throw new Error('processUserData: User data is required'); }\n  if (!rawUser._id) { throw new Error('processUserData: User ID (_id) is required'); }\n\n  return {\n    id: rawUser._id,\n    firstName: rawUser['Name - First'] || null,\n    lastName: rawUser['Name - Last'] || null,\n    fullName: rawUser['Name - Full'] || null,\n    profilePhoto: rawUser['Profile Photo'] || null,\n    // ... more fields\n  };\n}\n\nexport function processHostData(rawHost) {\n  if (!rawHost) { return null; }\n\n  return {\n    id: rawHost._id,\n    firstName: rawHost['Name - First'] || null,  // Same fields!\n    lastName: rawHost['Name - Last'] || null,\n    fullName: rawHost['Name - Full'] || null,\n    profilePhoto: rawHost['Profile Photo'] || null,\n    // ... identical to processUserData\n  };\n}\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// In processors/proposals/processProposalData.js:\n// REMOVE processUserData and processHostData functions\n// IMPORT from the canonical location instead:\n\nimport { processUserData } from '../user/processUserData.js';\n\n// processHostData is just processUserData with different null handling\n// Inline it or create a thin wrapper:\nfunction processHostData(rawHost) {\n  if (!rawHost) return null;\n  return processUserData({ rawUser: rawHost, requireVerification: false });\n}\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Update imports in files using processHostData\n- [ ] Verify host data displays correctly on /host-proposals\n- [ ] Verify guest data displays correctly on /guest-proposals\n\n~~~~~\n\n## PAGE GROUP: AUTO (Shared/Multiple Pages) (Chunks: 9, 10)\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 9: Inconsistent Status Field Access Pattern\n**Files:** Multiple files across rules and workflows\n**Line:** Various\n**Issue:** Throughout the codebase, proposal status is accessed inconsistently: sometimes as `proposal.status`, sometimes as `proposal.Status` (capital S), and sometimes with a fallback `proposal.status || proposal.Status`. This pattern repeats in 15+ locations and should be standardized.\n**Affected Pages:** AUTO (all proposal-related pages)\n\n**Current Code (example from proposalRules.js):**\n```javascript\nconst status = proposal.status || proposal.Status;  // Repeated 10+ times\n```\n\n**Current Code (example from processProposalData.js):**\n```javascript\nconst status = typeof rawProposal.Status === 'string'\n  ? rawProposal.Status.trim()\n  : (typeof rawProposal.status === 'string' ? rawProposal.status.trim() : 'Draft')\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// Create a utility function in processors/proposal/\n/**\n * Safely extract and normalize proposal status from raw data.\n * Handles both 'status' and 'Status' field names, trims whitespace.\n * @param {object} proposal - Raw or processed proposal object\n * @returns {string} Normalized status string\n */\nexport function getProposalStatus(proposal) {\n  if (!proposal) return 'Unknown';\n  const rawStatus = proposal.status ?? proposal.Status;\n  return typeof rawStatus === 'string' ? rawStatus.trim() : 'Unknown';\n}\n\n// Then use consistently:\nconst status = getProposalStatus(proposal);\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Create `getProposalStatus` utility function\n- [ ] Update all status access patterns to use it\n- [ ] Run full test suite to verify no regressions\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 10: Console Warnings Without Structured Logging\n**Files:** Multiple workflow files\n**Line:** Various\n**Issue:** Workflow files use bare `console.log` and `console.warn` for logging without structured context. This makes debugging difficult in production. Should use a consistent logging pattern with context objects.\n**Affected Pages:** AUTO (all pages with async operations)\n\n**Current Code (from counterofferWorkflow.js):**\n```javascript\nconsole.log('[counterofferWorkflow] Accepting counteroffer for proposal:', proposalId);\n// ...\nconsole.error('[counterofferWorkflow] Error accepting counteroffer:', error);\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// Create a logging utility (optional enhancement)\nconst log = {\n  info: (message, context) => console.log(`[counterofferWorkflow] ${message}`, context),\n  error: (message, error, context) => console.error(`[counterofferWorkflow] ${message}`, { error: error.message, ...context }),\n  warn: (message, context) => console.warn(`[counterofferWorkflow] ${message}`, context)\n};\n\n// Usage:\nlog.info('Accepting counteroffer', { proposalId });\nlog.error('Failed to accept counteroffer', error, { proposalId });\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Verify logs appear correctly in browser console\n- [ ] Test error scenarios to ensure context is captured\n\n~~~~~\n\n---\n\n## DEPENDENCY IMPACT SUMMARY\n\n### Files to Modify (Sorted by Impact)\n\n| File | Dependents | Risk Level | Chunks |\n|------|------------|------------|--------|\n| `constants/proposalStatuses.js` | 21 | CRITICAL | None (avoid) |\n| `rules/proposals/proposalRules.js` | 4 | HIGH | 1 |\n| `rules/proposals/proposalButtonRules.js` | 1 | LOW | 2, 3 |\n| `rules/proposals/useProposalButtonStates.js` | 0 | LOW | 2, 3 |\n| `workflows/proposals/cancelProposalWorkflow.js` | 3 | MEDIUM | 4 |\n| `workflows/booking/cancelProposalWorkflow.js` | 0 | LOW | 4 |\n| `processors/proposal/processProposalData.js` | 0 | LOW | 5 |\n| `processors/proposals/processProposalData.js` | 0 | LOW | 5, 8 |\n| `calculators/scheduling/isContiguousSelection.js` | 0 | LOW | 6 |\n| `workflows/proposals/counterofferWorkflow.js` | 0 | LOW | 7 |\n\n### Leaf Files (Safe to Refactor): 54 files\nMost files in the `calculators/` and individual `rules/` modules are leaf files with 0 dependents.\n\n### Recommended Execution Order\n1. **Chunk 1** (CRITICAL) - Fix duplicate import syntax error\n2. **Chunk 6** (EASY) - Fix malformed JSDoc\n3. **Chunk 7** (EASY) - Use imported rule function\n4. **Chunk 2, 3** - Consolidate button state logic\n5. **Chunk 4** - Consolidate cancel workflows\n6. **Chunk 5, 8** - Consolidate processors\n7. **Chunk 9, 10** - Cross-cutting improvements\n\n---\n\n## REFERENCED FILES\n\n### Primary Files to Modify\n- `app/src/logic/rules/proposals/proposalRules.js`\n- `app/src/logic/rules/proposals/proposalButtonRules.js`\n- `app/src/logic/rules/proposals/useProposalButtonStates.js`\n- `app/src/logic/workflows/proposals/cancelProposalWorkflow.js`\n- `app/src/logic/workflows/booking/cancelProposalWorkflow.js`\n- `app/src/logic/workflows/proposals/counterofferWorkflow.js`\n- `app/src/logic/processors/proposal/processProposalData.js`\n- `app/src/logic/processors/proposals/processProposalData.js`\n- `app/src/logic/calculators/scheduling/isContiguousSelection.js`\n\n### Dependent Files (Will Need Import Updates)\n- `app/src/islands/pages/proposals/ProposalCard.jsx`\n- `app/src/islands/pages/proposals/ExpandableProposalCard.jsx`\n- `app/src/islands/modals/GuestEditingProposalModal.jsx`\n- `app/src/hooks/useProposalButtonStates.js`\n\n### High-Impact File (DO NOT MODIFY)\n- `app/src/logic/constants/proposalStatuses.js` (21 dependents)\n",
