The `proposals/` version has additional utilities like `formatPrice`, `formatDate`, `getEffectiveTerms`, while `proposal/` version is focused purely on the processor pattern. This causes confusion and potential import errors.\n**Affected Pages:** /guest-proposals, /view-proposal\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n// In processors/proposal/processProposalData.js (149 lines)\nimport { PROPOSAL_STATUSES, getUsualOrder } from '../../constants/proposalStatuses.js'\n\nexport function processProposalData({ rawProposal, listing = null, guest = null, host = null }) {\n  // No Fallback: Proposal data must exist\n  if (!rawProposal) {\n    throw new Error('processProposalData: rawProposal cannot be null or undefined')\n  }\n  // ... focused on clean merge of original/counteroffer terms\n}\n\n// In processors/proposals/processProposalData.js (330 lines)\nexport function processProposalData(rawProposal) {\n  // Different signature - takes raw proposal directly\n  // Includes nested processListingData, processHostData calls\n  // Also exports: formatPrice, formatDate, formatDateTime, getEffectiveTerms, getProposalDisplayText\n}\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// Delete processors/proposals/ directory entirely\n// Keep processors/proposal/processProposalData.js as the single source of truth\n\n// Move utility functions from processors/proposals/processProposalData.js to:\n// - formatPrice, formatDate, formatDateTime \u2192 processors/display/formatters.js (new file)\n// - getEffectiveTerms \u2192 processors/proposal/getEffectiveTerms.js (new file)\n// - getProposalDisplayText \u2192 processors/proposal/getProposalDisplayText.js (new file)\n// - processUserData already exists at processors/user/processUserData.js\n// - processListingData already exists conceptually (should be created properly)\n\n// Update import in loadProposalDetailsWorkflow.js:\nimport { processProposalData } from '../../processors/proposal/processProposalData.js'\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Search codebase for all imports of `processors/proposals/`\n- [ ] Update imports to use `processors/proposal/`\n- [ ] Verify /guest-proposals page renders correctly\n- [ ] Verify proposal data displays correctly in all proposal-related pages\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 2: Consolidate duplicate cancelProposalWorkflow files\n**Files:** `workflows/booking/cancelProposalWorkflow.js`, `workflows/proposals/cancelProposalWorkflow.js`\n**Line:** N/A (whole files)\n**Issue:** Two workflow files handle proposal cancellation with overlapping but different implementations. `booking/` version uses dependency injection pattern, `proposals/` version imports supabase directly.

Console statements execute on every price calculation.\n\n**Approach:** Remove all console.log statements. If debugging is needed, use a conditional logger that respects NODE_ENV.\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\nexport const calculatePrice = (selectedNights, listing, reservationSpan = 13, zatConfig = null) => {\n  const nightsCount = selectedNights.length;\n\n  console.log('=== CALCULATE PRICE ===');\n  console.log('nightsCount:', nightsCount);\n  console.log('listing rental type:', listing?.['rental type'] || listing?.rentalType);\n  console.log('reservationSpan:', reservationSpan);\n\n  if (nightsCount === 0) {\n    return createEmptyPriceBreakdown();\n  }\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\nexport const calculatePrice = (selectedNights, listing, reservationSpan = 13, zatConfig = null) => {\n  const nightsCount = selectedNights.length;\n\n  if (nightsCount === 0) {\n    return createEmptyPriceBreakdown();\n  }\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Run `bun run build` to verify no syntax errors\n- [ ] Navigate to /search and verify pricing still displays correctly\n- [ ] Navigate to /view-split-lease and test schedule selector pricing\n- [ ] Check browser console for absence of pricing debug logs\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 2: Remove result logging from priceCalculations.js\n\n**Files:** `src\\lib\\scheduleSelector\\priceCalculations.js`\n**Line:** 88-93\n**Issue:** Result logging after every calculation adds overhead\n**Affected Pages:** /search, /view-split-lease, /preview-split-lease\n\n**Rationale:** Groups with CHUNK 1 - same file, same category of change.\n\n**Approach:** Remove console statements from the result section.\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n  const initialPayment = fourWeekRent + cleaningFee + damageDeposit;\n\n  console.log('=== PRICE CALCULATION RESULT ===');\n  console.log('pricePerNight:', pricePerNight);\n  console.log('fourWeekRent:', fourWeekRent);\n  console.log('reservationTotal:', reservationTotal);\n  console.log('initialPayment:', initialPayment);\n\n  return {\n    basePrice: fourWeekRent,\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n  const initialPayment = fourWeekRent + cleaningFee + damageDeposit;\n\n  return {\n    basePrice: fourWeekRent,\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Verify price breakdown shows correct values on /view-split-lease\n- [ ] Confirm no console output during price calculations\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 3: Remove Monthly calculation logging from priceCalculations.js\n\n**Files:** `src\\lib\\scheduleSelector\\priceCalculations.js`\n**Line:** 157-169\n**Issue:** Verbose logging inside monthly rental calculation\n**Affected Pages:** /search, /view-split-lease (Monthly rental type listings)\n\n**Rationale:** Continues cleanup of same file.\n\n**Approach:** Remove the console.log statement inside calculateMonthlyPrice function.\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n  // Step 9: Calculate 4-Week Rent\n  const fourWeekRent = (pricePerNight * nightsCount * 4) / weeklySchedulePeriod;\n\n  console.log('Monthly calculation:', {\n    monthlyAvgNightly,\n    averageWeeklyPrice,\n    nightlyHostRate,\n    unusedNights,\n    unusedNightsDiscountValue,\n    multiplier,\n    totalWeeklyPrice,\n    pricePerNight,\n    weeklySchedulePeriod,\n    fourWeekRent,\n    reservationTotal\n  });\n\n  return { pricePerNight, fourWeekRent, reservationTotal };\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n  // Step 9: Calculate 4-Week Rent\n  const fourWeekRent = (pricePerNight * nightsCount * 4) / weeklySchedulePeriod;\n\n  // Step 11: Calculate Total Reservation Price\n  const reservationTotal = calculateTotalReservationPrice(\n    pricePerNight,\n    nightsCount,\n    reservationSpan,\n    weeksOffered\n  );\n\n  return { pricePerNight, fourWeekRent, reservationTotal };\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Test with a Monthly rental type listing\n- [ ] Verify pricing displays correctly\n\n~~~~~\n\n## PAGE GROUP: /view-split-lease (Chunks: 4, 5)\n\n### CHUNK 4: Fix ESLint-disabled hooks in useScheduleSelector.js (onSelectionChange)\n\n**Files:** `src\\islands\\shared\\useScheduleSelector.js`\n**Line:** 154-157\n**Issue:** ESLint react-hooks/exhaustive-deps rule disabled - risk of stale closures\n**Affected Pages:** /view-split-lease, /search (any page using schedule selector)\n\n**Rationale:** The callback `onSelectionChange` is intentionally excluded from deps because we only want to notify when `selectedDays` changes, not when the callback reference changes.

This creates API confusion and potential bugs.\n**Affected Pages:** /guest-proposals, /view-proposal, /host-proposals\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n/**\n * Check if a proposal can be cancelled by the guest\n * Based on Bubble.io workflows crkec5, crswt2, crtCg2, curuC4, curuK4, curua4\n *\n * @param {Object} proposal - Proposal object\n * @returns {boolean} True if proposal can be cancelled\n */\nexport function canCancelProposal(proposal) {\n  if (!proposal) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  const status = proposal.status || proposal.Status;\n\n  // Can't cancel if already cancelled or rejected\n  if (\n    status === PROPOSAL_STATUSES.CANCELLED_BY_GUEST.key ||\n    status === PROPOSAL_STATUSES.CANCELLED_BY_SPLITLEASE.key ||\n    status === PROPOSAL_STATUSES.REJECTED_BY_HOST.key\n  ) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  // Can't cancel if lease is already activated\n  if (isCompletedStatus(status)) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  // Can't cancel if expired\n  if (status === PROPOSAL_STATUSES.EXPIRED.key) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  // Otherwise, can cancel\n  return true;\n}\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// DELETE this function entirely from proposalRules.js\n// The canonical version is in canCancelProposal.js with named parameters\n// Re-export from canCancelProposal.js to maintain backward compatibility:\nexport { canCancelProposal } from './canCancelProposal.js';\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Search for all imports of `canCancelProposal` from `proposalRules.js`\n- [ ] Update imports to use `canCancelProposal.js` directly\n- [ ] Verify cancel button works on /guest-proposals page\n- [ ] Run unit tests for proposal cancellation\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 2: Standardize proposal rule function signatures\n**Files:** `app/src/logic/rules/proposals/canAcceptProposal.js`, `app/src/logic/rules/proposals/canCancelProposal.js`, `app/src/logic/rules/proposals/canEditProposal.js`\n**Line:** Multiple (function signatures)\n**Issue:** **HIGH** - These 3 files use consistent `{ proposalStatus, deleted }` params, but `proposalRules.js` functions use `(proposal)` object. The inconsistency causes cognitive overhead when using these rules.\n**Affected Pages:** /guest-proposals, /view-proposal, /host-proposals\n\n**Current Code (proposalRules.js lines 63-72):**\n```javascript\nexport function canModifyProposal(proposal) {\n  if (!proposal) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  const status = proposal.status || proposal.Status;\n\n  // Can only modify if in initial submission stage\n  return status === PROPOSAL_STATUSES.PROPOSAL_SUBMITTED_AWAITING_RENTAL_APP.key;\n}\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n/**\n * Check if a proposal can be modified/edited by the guest.\n * Only allowed in early stages before rental application submission.\n *\n * @param {object} params - Named parameters.\n * @param {string} params.proposalStatus - The \"Proposal Status\" field from Supabase.\n * @param {boolean} [params.deleted=false] - Whether proposal is soft-deleted.\n * @returns {boolean} True if proposal can be modified.\n */\nexport function canModifyProposal({ proposalStatus, deleted = false }) {\n  if (deleted) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  if (!proposalStatus || typeof proposalStatus !== 'string') {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  const status = proposalStatus.trim();\n  return status === PROPOSAL_STATUSES.PROPOSAL_SUBMITTED_AWAITING_RENTAL_APP.key;\n}\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Update all call sites to pass named parameters\n- [ ] Verify proposal edit button visibility on /guest-proposals\n- [ ] Run unit tests for proposal modification\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 3: Consolidate duplicate status extraction pattern\n**File:** `app/src/logic/rules/proposals/proposalRules.js`\n**Lines:** 31, 68, 85, 124, 141, 157, 179, 196, 213, 231, 247, 264, 281, 358\n**Issue:** **MEDIUM** - The pattern `proposal.status || proposal.Status` is repeated 14+ times.

status extraction repeated 14x | Extract private utility function |\n| 4 | `app/src/logic/rules/proposals/proposalRules.js` | Fallback mechanism violates \"Building for Truth\" | Remove fallback, surface error properly |\n| 5 | `app/src/logic/rules/search/isValidPriceTier.js`, `app/src/logic/rules/search/isValidSortOption.js`, `app/src/logic/rules/search/isValidWeekPattern.js` | Magic strings should be exported constants | Export arrays as named constants |\n| 6 | `app/src/logic/rules/users/isHost.js`, `app/src/logic/rules/users/isGuest.js` | Duplicate logic for internal users | Extract to shared userTypeUtils.js |\n| 7 | `app/src/logic/rules/users/hasProfilePhoto.js` | Verbose null checks | Simplify while maintaining behavior |\n| 8 | `app/src/logic/rules/proposals/virtualMeetingRules.js` | Legacy aliases should be deprecated properly | Split into main enum and deprecated aliases |\n\n---\n\n## File References\n\n### Files to Modify\n- `app/src/logic/rules/proposals/proposalRules.js` (Chunks 1, 2, 3, 4)\n- `app/src/logic/rules/search/isValidPriceTier.js` (Chunk 5)\n- `app/src/logic/rules/search/isValidSortOption.js` (Chunk 5)\n- `app/src/logic/rules/search/isValidWeekPattern.js` (Chunk 5)\n- `app/src/logic/rules/users/isHost.js` (Chunk 6)\n- `app/src/logic/rules/users/isGuest.js` (Chunk 6)\n- `app/src/logic/rules/users/hasProfilePhoto.js` (Chunk 7)\n- `app/src/logic/rules/proposals/virtualMeetingRules.js` (Chunk 8)\n\n### Files to Create\n- `app/src/logic/rules/users/userTypeUtils.js` (Chunk 6)\n\n### Files with Good Code (No Changes Needed)\n- `app/src/logic/rules/auth/isSessionValid.js` - Clean, focused, proper validation\n- `app/src/logic/rules/auth/isProtectedPage.js` - Well-documented, correct logic\n- `app/src/logic/rules/pricing/isValidDayCountForPricing.js` - Simple, correct\n- `app/src/logic/rules/scheduling/isDateBlocked.js` - Proper validation, handles edge cases\n- `app/src/logic/rules/scheduling/isDateInRange.js` - Thorough, well-documented\n- `app/src/logic/rules/scheduling/isScheduleContiguous.js` - Complex but correct wrap-around logic\n- `app/src/logic/rules/proposals/canAcceptProposal.js` - Follows named param pattern correctly\n- `app/src/logic/rules/proposals/canCancelProposal.js` - Follows named param pattern correctly\n- `app/src/logic/rules/proposals/canEditProposal.js` - Follows named param pattern correctly\n- `app/src/logic/rules/proposals/determineProposalStage.js` - Clean, uses constants properly\n- `app/src/logic/rules/proposals/useProposalButtonStates.js` - Complex but necessary hook\n- `app/src/logic/rules/reminders/reminderScheduling.js` - Well-structured predicates\n- `app/src/logic/rules/reminders/reminderValidation.js` - Clean validation rules\n- `app/src/logic/rules/reviews/reviewValidation.js` - Simple, correct\n- `app/src/logic/rules/users/shouldShowFullName.js` - Proper validation\n- `app/src/logic/rules/search/hasListingPhotos.js` - Handles JSON string edge case\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Priority\n\n1. **Chunk 1** - CRITICAL: Fix duplicate function before other work\n2. **Chunk 2** - HIGH: Standardize signatures after removing duplicate\n3. **Chunk 3** - MEDIUM: DRY improvement, easy win\n4. **Chunk 5** - MEDIUM: Export constants for UI reuse\n5. **Chunk 6** - MEDIUM: Consolidate user type logic\n6. **Chunk 4** - MEDIUM: Remove fallback (may need UI updates)\n7. **Chunk 7** - LOW: Minor optimization\n8. **Chunk 8** - LOW: Deprecation cleanup\n",

Primary issues:\n\n1. **DAY_NAMES Duplication** - Constant defined 8 times across codebase (CRITICAL)\n2. **Console Logging Proliferation** - 652 console statements in islands alone (HIGH)\n3. **useSearchPageLogic Complexity** - 22 console.log statements, 28 useState calls (HIGH)\n4. **Empty/Silent Catch Blocks** - 144 files with potential error swallowing (MEDIUM)\n5. **Missing Error Boundaries** - Page components lack error handling (MEDIUM)\n\n### Scope Note\n\nPrevious plans covered:\n- `20260118170459` - `app/src/logic/` (calculators, constants, processors, workflows)\n- `20260118165142` - Console logging in priceCalculations.js, useScheduleSelector.js, workflow files\n- `20260118163519` - `app/src/logic/rules/` (proposals, search, users)\n\nThis plan focuses on **NEW issues not covered by previous plans**.\n\n---\n\n## Chunk Summary\n\n| Chunk | Files | Rationale | Approach |\n|-------|-------|-----------|----------|\n| 1 | 8 files (duplicated DAY_NAMES) | CRITICAL duplication across codebase | Consolidate to single export in dayUtils.js |\n| 2 | `app/src/islands/pages/useSearchPageLogic.js` | 22 console.log statements polluting production | Remove debug logging |\n| 3 | `app/src/islands/shared/Header.jsx` | 27 console.log statements | Remove debug logging |\n| 4 | `app/src/islands/pages/SelfListingPage/SelfListingPage.tsx` | 31 console statements, complex component | Extract logging, add error boundary |\n| 5 | `app/src/islands/pages/MessagingPage/useMessagingPageLogic.js` | 24 console statements | Remove debug logging |\n| 6 | `app/src/islands/pages/FavoriteListingsPage/FavoriteListingsPage.jsx` | 20 console statements + missing error handling | Remove logging, add error boundary |\n| 7 | `app/src/islands/shared/SignUpLoginModal.jsx` | 24 console statements | Remove debug logging |\n| 8 | `app/src/islands/shared/LoggedInAvatar/useLoggedInAvatarData.js` | 19 console statements in shared component | Remove debug logging |\n| 9 | `app/src/islands/pages/useRentalApplicationPageLogic.js` | 26 console statements | Remove debug logging |\n| 10 | `app/src/islands/shared/AiSignupMarketReport/AiSignupMarketReport.jsx` | 64 console statements in a single component | Remove debug logging |\n| 11 | `app/src/lib/safeJson.js` | Fallback mechanism violates \"Building for Truth\" | Surface errors instead of swallowing |\n\n---\n\n~~~~~\n\n## PAGE GROUP: AUTO (Shared Constant - All Pages) (Chunks: 1)\n\n### CHUNK 1: Consolidate duplicate DAY_NAMES constant\n\n**Files:**\n- `app/src/islands/shared/CreateProposalFlowV2.jsx`\n- `app/src/islands/shared/CreateProposalFlowV2Components/DaysSelectionSection.jsx`\n- `app/src/islands/pages/AccountProfilePage/useAccountProfilePageLogic.js`\n- `app/src/islands/pages/AccountProfilePage/components/PublicView.jsx`\n- `app/src/islands/pages/AccountProfilePage/components/cards/ScheduleCommuteCard.jsx`\n- `app/src/islands/pages/proposals/ProposalCard.jsx`\n- `app/src/logic/workflows/scheduling/validateScheduleWorkflow.js`\n- `app/src/logic/workflows/scheduling/validateMoveInDateWorkflow.js`\n\n**Line:** Various (see each file)\n**Issue:** **CRITICAL** - `DAY_NAMES` constant is defined 8 times across the codebase. This violates DRY principle and creates maintenance burden when day ordering needs to change. The canonical export exists in `lib/dayUtils.js` but is not being used.\n**Affected Pages:** /view-split-lease, /guest-proposals, /account-profile, /search (proposal creation)\n\n**Rationale:** The constant `['Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday']` appears in 8 files. Some files already correctly import from `lib/dayUtils.js` (4 files), while 8 files define it locally.\n\n**Approach:**\n1. Verify `lib/dayUtils.js` exports `DAY_NAMES`\n2. Remove local definitions from all 8 files\n3. Add import from `lib/dayUtils.js` to each file\n\n**Current Code (example from CreateProposalFlowV2.jsx line 21):**\n```javascript\n// Day name constants for check-in/check-out calculation\nconst DAY_NAMES = ['Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday'];\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// Import from canonical source\nimport { DAY_NAMES } from '../../lib/dayUtils.js';\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Verify `lib/dayUtils.js` exports DAY_NAMES\n- [ ] Update all 8 files to import from dayUtils.js\n- [ ] Run `bun run build` to verify no import errors\n- [ ] Test proposal creation on /view-split-lease\n- [ ] Test schedule display on /account-profile\n\n~~~~~\n\n## PAGE GROUP: /search (Chunks: 2)\n\n### CHUNK 2: Remove verbose logging from useSearchPageLogic.js\n\n**Files:** `app/src/islands/pages/useSearchPageLogic.js`\n**Lines:** 216, 231-239, 286-289, 307, 311, 369, 373-377, 416-420, 427, 429-437, 464, 522, 543-551, 563-565, 624, 703-710\n**Issue:** **HIGH** - 22 console.log/warn/error statements pollute browser console during normal operation\n**Affected Pages:** /search\n\n**Rationale:** This is the main logic hook for the search page. Every filter change triggers multiple console.log calls, creating noise and performance overhead.\n\n**Approach:** Remove all console.log statements except console.error for actual errors. The ESLint rule `no-console` should catch future additions.\n\n**Current Code (lines 216-239, truncated):**\n```javascript\nconst fetchAllActiveListings = useCallback(async () => {\n  console.log('\ud83c\udf0d Fetching ALL active listings for map background (green pins)...')\n\n  try {\n    const { data, error } = await supabase\n      .from('listing')\n      // ...\n\n    console.log('\ud83d\udcca fetchAllActiveListings: Supabase returned', data.length, 'active listings')\n\n    // Batch fetch photos\n    const photoIdsArray = extractPhotoIdsFromListings(data)\n    console.log('\ud83d\udcf7 fetchAllActiveListings: Collected', photoIdsArray.length, 'unique photo IDs')\n    console.log('\ud83d\udcf7 fetchAllActiveListings: Sample photo IDs:', photoIdsArray.slice(0, 3))\n\n    const photoMap = await fetchPhotoUrls(photoIdsArray)\n    console.log('\ud83d\udcf7 fetchAllActiveListings: photoMap has', Object.keys(photoMap).length, 'entries')\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\nconst fetchAllActiveListings = useCallback(async () => {\n  try {\n    const { data, error } = await supabase\n      .from('listing')\n      // ...\n\n    // Batch fetch photos\n    const photoIdsArray = extractPhotoIdsFromListings(data)\n    const photoMap = await fetchPhotoUrls(photoIdsArray)\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Verify search page still loads listings correctly\n- [ ] Test filter changes (borough, price, week pattern)\n- [ ] Check browser console for absence of debug logs\n- [ ] Verify errors are still logged on API failures\n\n~~~~~\n\n## PAGE GROUP: AUTO (Header - All Pages) (Chunks: 3)\n\n### CHUNK 3: Remove verbose logging from Header.jsx\n\n**Files:** `app/src/islands/shared/Header.jsx`\n**Lines:** Multiple (27 console statements)\n**Issue:** **HIGH** - Header component logs on every render affecting all pages\n**Affected Pages:** AUTO (Header appears on every page)\n\n**Rationale:** The Header component is loaded on every page. Console logging in this shared component multiplies across the entire application.\n\n**Approach:** Remove all debug console.log statements, keep console.error for actual failures.\n\n**Current Code (example pattern):**\n```javascript\nuseEffect(() => {\n  console.log('Header mounted');\n  console.log('User state:', user);\n  // ... initialization logic\n}, []);\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\nuseEffect(() => {\n  // ... initialization logic (no debug logging)\n}, []);\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Verify header renders correctly on homepage\n- [ ] Test login/logout state changes\n- [ ] Check browser console for absence of header-related logs\n- [ ] Test mobile menu functionality\n\n~~~~~\n\n## PAGE GROUP: /self-listing-v2, /self-listing (Chunks: 4)\n\n### CHUNK 4: Remove verbose logging from SelfListingPage.tsx\n\n**Files:** `app/src/islands/pages/SelfListingPage/SelfListingPage.tsx`\n**Lines:** Multiple (31 console statements)\n**Issue:** **HIGH** - Self-listing form logs extensively during form interactions\n**Affected Pages:** /self-listing, /self-listing-v2\n\n**Rationale:** This TypeScript file has 31 console statements.

This plan addresses the highest-impact files. A follow-up plan may be needed to address remaining files.\n\n2. **ESLint Configuration**: Consider adding `no-console` rule to `eslint.config.js` to prevent future logging proliferation (with exceptions for console.error).\n\n3. **Error Boundaries**: Many page components lack React Error Boundaries. Consider adding as a separate initiative.\n\n4. **Testing Coverage**: Each chunk should be tested in the development environment before production deployment.\n"

Primary issues:\n\n1. **DAY_NAMES Duplication** - Constant defined 8 times across codebase (CRITICAL)\n2. **Console Logging Proliferation** - 652 console statements in islands alone (HIGH)\n3. **useSearchPageLogic Complexity** - 22 console.log statements, 28 useState calls (HIGH)\n4. **Empty/Silent Catch Blocks** - 144 files with potential error swallowing (MEDIUM)\n5. **Missing Error Boundaries** - Page components lack error handling (MEDIUM)\n\n### Scope Note\n\nPrevious plans covered:\n- `20260118170459` - `app/src/logic/` (calculators, constants, processors, workflows)\n- `20260118165142` - Console logging in priceCalculations.js, useScheduleSelector.js, workflow files\n- `20260118163519` - `app/src/logic/rules/` (proposals, search, users)\n\nThis plan focuses on **NEW issues not covered by previous plans**.\n\n---\n\n## Chunk Summary\n\n| Chunk | Files | Rationale | Approach |\n|-------|-------|-----------|----------|\n| 1 | 8 files (duplicated DAY_NAMES) | CRITICAL duplication across codebase | Consolidate to single export in dayUtils.js |\n| 2 | `app/src/islands/pages/useSearchPageLogic.js` | 22 console.log statements polluting production | Remove debug logging |\n| 3 | `app/src/islands/shared/Header.jsx` | 27 console.log statements | Remove debug logging |\n| 4 | `app/src/islands/pages/SelfListingPage/SelfListingPage.tsx` | 31 console statements, complex component | Extract logging, add error boundary |\n| 5 | `app/src/islands/pages/MessagingPage/useMessagingPageLogic.js` | 24 console statements | Remove debug logging |\n| 6 | `app/src/islands/pages/FavoriteListingsPage/FavoriteListingsPage.jsx` | 20 console statements + missing error handling | Remove logging, add error boundary |\n| 7 | `app/src/islands/shared/SignUpLoginModal.jsx` | 24 console statements | Remove debug logging |\n| 8 | `app/src/islands/shared/LoggedInAvatar/useLoggedInAvatarData.js` | 19 console statements in shared component | Remove debug logging |\n| 9 | `app/src/islands/pages/useRentalApplicationPageLogic.js` | 26 console statements | Remove debug logging |\n| 10 | `app/src/islands/shared/AiSignupMarketReport/AiSignupMarketReport.jsx` | 64 console statements in a single component | Remove debug logging |\n| 11 | `app/src/lib/safeJson.js` | Fallback mechanism violates \"Building for Truth\" | Surface errors instead of swallowing |\n\n---\n\n~~~~~\n\n## PAGE GROUP: AUTO (Shared Constant - All Pages) (Chunks: 1)\n\n### CHUNK 1: Consolidate duplicate DAY_NAMES constant\n\n**Files:**\n- `app/src/islands/shared/CreateProposalFlowV2.jsx`\n- `app/src/islands/shared/CreateProposalFlowV2Components/DaysSelectionSection.jsx`\n- `app/src/islands/pages/AccountProfilePage/useAccountProfilePageLogic.js`\n- `app/src/islands/pages/AccountProfilePage/components/PublicView.jsx`\n- `app/src/islands/pages/AccountProfilePage/components/cards/ScheduleCommuteCard.jsx`\n- `app/src/islands/pages/proposals/ProposalCard.jsx`\n- `app/src/logic/workflows/scheduling/validateScheduleWorkflow.js`\n- `app/src/logic/workflows/scheduling/validateMoveInDateWorkflow.js`\n\n**Line:** Various (see each file)\n**Issue:** **CRITICAL** - `DAY_NAMES` constant is defined 8 times across the codebase. This violates DRY principle and creates maintenance burden when day ordering needs to change. The canonical export exists in `lib/dayUtils.js` but is not being used.\n**Affected Pages:** /view-split-lease, /guest-proposals, /account-profile, /search (proposal creation)\n\n**Rationale:** The constant `['Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday']` appears in 8 files. Some files already correctly import from `lib/dayUtils.js` (4 files), while 8 files define it locally.\n\n**Approach:**\n1. Verify `lib/dayUtils.js` exports `DAY_NAMES`\n2. Remove local definitions from all 8 files\n3. Add import from `lib/dayUtils.js` to each file\n\n**Current Code (example from CreateProposalFlowV2.jsx line 21):**\n```javascript\n// Day name constants for check-in/check-out calculation\nconst DAY_NAMES = ['Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday'];\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// Import from canonical source\nimport { DAY_NAMES } from '../../lib/dayUtils.js';\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Verify `lib/dayUtils.js` exports DAY_NAMES\n- [ ] Update all 8 files to import from dayUtils.js\n- [ ] Run `bun run build` to verify no import errors\n- [ ] Test proposal creation on /view-split-lease\n- [ ] Test schedule display on /account-profile\n\n~~~~~\n\n## PAGE GROUP: /search (Chunks: 2)\n\n### CHUNK 2: Remove verbose logging from useSearchPageLogic.js\n\n**Files:** `app/src/islands/pages/useSearchPageLogic.js`\n**Lines:** 216, 231-239, 286-289, 307, 311, 369, 373-377, 416-420, 427, 429-437, 464, 522, 543-551, 563-565, 624, 703-710\n**Issue:** **HIGH** - 22 console.log/warn/error statements pollute browser console during normal operation\n**Affected Pages:** /search\n\n**Rationale:** This is the main logic hook for the search page. Every filter change triggers multiple console.log calls, creating noise and performance overhead.\n\n**Approach:** Remove all console.log statements except console.error for actual errors. The ESLint rule `no-console` should catch future additions.\n\n**Current Code (lines 216-239, truncated):**\n```javascript\nconst fetchAllActiveListings = useCallback(async () => {\n  console.log('\ud83c\udf0d Fetching ALL active listings for map background (green pins)...')\n\n  try {\n    const { data, error } = await supabase\n      .from('listing')\n      // ...\n\n    console.log('\ud83d\udcca fetchAllActiveListings: Supabase returned', data.length, 'active listings')\n\n    // Batch fetch photos\n    const photoIdsArray = extractPhotoIdsFromListings(data)\n    console.log('\ud83d\udcf7 fetchAllActiveListings: Collected', photoIdsArray.length, 'unique photo IDs')\n    console.log('\ud83d\udcf7 fetchAllActiveListings: Sample photo IDs:', photoIdsArray.slice(0, 3))\n\n    const photoMap = await fetchPhotoUrls(photoIdsArray)\n    console.log('\ud83d\udcf7 fetchAllActiveListings: photoMap has', Object.keys(photoMap).length, 'entries')\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\nconst fetchAllActiveListings = useCallback(async () => {\n  try {\n    const { data, error } = await supabase\n      .from('listing')\n      // ...\n\n    // Batch fetch photos\n    const photoIdsArray = extractPhotoIdsFromListings(data)\n    const photoMap = await fetchPhotoUrls(photoIdsArray)\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Verify search page still loads listings correctly\n- [ ] Test filter changes (borough, price, week pattern)\n- [ ] Check browser console for absence of debug logs\n- [ ] Verify errors are still logged on API failures\n\n~~~~~\n\n## PAGE GROUP: AUTO (Header - All Pages) (Chunks: 3)\n\n### CHUNK 3: Remove verbose logging from Header.jsx\n\n**Files:** `app/src/islands/shared/Header.jsx`\n**Lines:** Multiple (27 console statements)\n**Issue:** **HIGH** - Header component logs on every render affecting all pages\n**Affected Pages:** AUTO (Header appears on every page)\n\n**Rationale:** The Header component is loaded on every page.

As a multi-step form, each step transition and validation triggers logging.\n\n**Approach:** Remove all debug logging. Consider adding error boundary for production stability.\n\n**Current Code (typical pattern):**\n```typescript\nconst handleNextStep = () => {\n  console.log('Moving to next step:', currentStep + 1);\n  console.log('Form data:', formData);\n  setCurrentStep(currentStep + 1);\n};\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```typescript\nconst handleNextStep = () => {\n  setCurrentStep(currentStep + 1);\n};\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Test full self-listing flow from step 1 to submission\n- [ ] Verify form validation still works\n- [ ] Check console for absence of step transition logs\n- [ ] Test photo upload section\n\n~~~~~\n\n## PAGE GROUP: /messages (Chunks: 5)\n\n### CHUNK 5: Remove verbose logging from useMessagingPageLogic.js\n\n**Files:** `app/src/islands/pages/MessagingPage/useMessagingPageLogic.js`\n**Lines:** Multiple (24 console statements)\n**Issue:** **HIGH** - Messaging page logs on message load and send\n**Affected Pages:** /messages\n\n**Rationale:** The messaging system logs heavily during conversation loading and message sending, creating console noise during normal chat usage.\n\n**Approach:** Remove debug logging, keep error logging for failed message sends.\n\n**Current Code (typical pattern):**\n```javascript\nconst loadConversations = async () => {\n  console.log('Loading conversations for user:', userId);\n  const { data, error } = await supabase\n    .from('messages')\n    // ...\n  console.log('Loaded', data.length, 'conversations');\n};\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\nconst loadConversations = async () => {\n  const { data, error } = await supabase\n    .from('messages')\n    // ...\n  if (error) {\n    console.error('[MessagingPage] Failed to load conversations:', error);\n    throw error;\n  }\n};\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Test loading conversation list\n- [ ] Test sending and receiving messages\n- [ ] Verify real-time updates still work\n- [ ] Check error handling on API failures\n\n~~~~~\n\n## PAGE GROUP: /favorite-listings (Chunks: 6)\n\n### CHUNK 6: Remove verbose logging from FavoriteListingsPage.jsx\n\n**Files:** `app/src/islands/pages/FavoriteListingsPage/FavoriteListingsPage.jsx`\n**Lines:** Multiple (20 console statements)\n**Issue:** **MEDIUM** - Favorites page logs on load and interactions\n**Affected Pages:** /favorite-listings\n\n**Rationale:** Console logging during favorite loading and card interactions.\n\n**Approach:** Remove debug logging.\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\nuseEffect(() => {\n  console.log('Loading favorite listings...');\n  loadFavorites();\n}, []);\n\nconst handleRemoveFavorite = (listingId) => {\n  console.log('Removing favorite:', listingId);\n  // ... removal logic\n};\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\nuseEffect(() => {\n  loadFavorites();\n}, []);\n\nconst handleRemoveFavorite = (listingId) => {\n  // ... removal logic\n};\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Test loading favorites list\n- [ ] Test removing a favorite\n- [ ] Test clicking through to listing detail\n\n~~~~~\n\n## PAGE GROUP: AUTO (Auth Modal - All Pages) (Chunks: 7)\n\n### CHUNK 7: Remove verbose logging from SignUpLoginModal.jsx\n\n**Files:** `app/src/islands/shared/SignUpLoginModal.jsx`\n**Lines:** Multiple (24 console statements)\n**Issue:** **MEDIUM** - Auth modal logs during signup/login flow\n**Affected Pages:** AUTO (modal can appear on any page)\n\n**Rationale:** The signup/login modal is a shared component that can be triggered from any page. Console logging during authentication affects user experience debugging but shouldn't be in production.\n\n**Approach:** Remove debug logging, keep error logging for auth failures.\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\nconst handleLogin = async () => {\n  console.log('Attempting login with:', email);\n  try {\n    const result = await loginUser(email, password);\n    console.log('Login successful:', result);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Login failed:', error);\n  }\n};\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\nconst handleLogin = async () => {\n  try {\n    const result = await loginUser(email, password);\n    // success handled silently\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('[SignUpLoginModal] Login failed:', error.message);\n    // show user-facing error\n  }\n};\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Test login flow\n- [ ] Test signup flow\n- [ ] Test OAuth flows if applicable\n- [ ] Verify errors are still logged for debugging\n\n~~~~~\n\n## PAGE GROUP: AUTO (Avatar - All Pages) (Chunks: 8)\n\n### CHUNK 8: Remove verbose logging from useLoggedInAvatarData.js\n\n**Files:** `app/src/islands/shared/LoggedInAvatar/useLoggedInAvatarData.js`\n**Lines:** Multiple (19 console statements)\n**Issue:** **MEDIUM** - Avatar component logs on every page load\n**Affected Pages:** AUTO (avatar appears in header on all pages)\n\n**Rationale:** The logged-in avatar hook logs user data fetching on every page load. This creates repetitive console noise across the entire application.\n\n**Approach:** Remove all debug logging.\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\nuseEffect(() => {\n  console.log('Fetching avatar data for user:', userId);\n  fetchAvatarData();\n}, [userId]);\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\nuseEffect(() => {\n  fetchAvatarData();\n}, [userId]);\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Verify avatar displays correctly when logged in\n- [ ] Test avatar dropdown menu\n- [ ] Check console for absence of avatar-related logs\n\n~~~~~\n\n## PAGE GROUP: /rental-application (Chunks: 9)\n\n### CHUNK 9: Remove verbose logging from useRentalApplicationPageLogic.js\n\n**Files:** `app/src/islands/pages/useRentalApplicationPageLogic.js`\n**Lines:** Multiple (26 console statements)\n**Issue:** **MEDIUM** - Rental application form logs extensively\n**Affected Pages:** /rental-application\n\n**Rationale:** Multi-step rental application form logs on every step and field change.\n\n**Approach:** Remove debug logging, keep error logging for submission failures.\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Test rental application form submission\n- [ ] Verify form validation\n- [ ] Check step navigation\n\n~~~~~\n\n## PAGE GROUP: /search (AI Research Modal) (Chunks: 10)\n\n### CHUNK 10: Remove verbose logging from AiSignupMarketReport.jsx\n\n**Files:** `app/src/islands/shared/AiSignupMarketReport/AiSignupMarketReport.jsx`\n**Lines:** Multiple (64 console statements!)\n**Issue:** **HIGH** - Single component with 64 console statements\n**Affected Pages:** /search (AI Research modal)\n\n**Rationale:** This component has the highest concentration of console logging in the codebase. The AI parsing logic logs every extraction attempt.\n\n**Approach:** Remove all debug logging. If AI debugging is needed, use a feature flag or dev-only logging.\n\n**Current Code (typical pattern):**\n```javascript\nfunction extractEmail(text) {\n  console.log('Extracting email from:', text);\n  const match = text.match(emailRegex);\n  console.log('Email match result:', match);\n  return match ? match[0] : null;\n}\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\nfunction extractEmail(text) {\n  if (!text) return null;\n  const match = text.match(emailRegex);\n  return match ? match[0] : null;\n}\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Test AI research modal opens correctly\n- [ ] Test email extraction from freeform text\n- [ ] Test phone number extraction\n- [ ] Test name extraction\n- [ ] Verify form submission works\n\n~~~~~\n\n## PAGE GROUP: AUTO (Safe JSON - All Pages) (Chunks: 11)\n\n### CHUNK 11: Remove silent fallback from safeJsonParse\n\n**Files:** `app/src/lib/safeJson.js`\n**Lines:** 12-23\n**Issue:** **MEDIUM** - Silent fallback violates \"Building for Truth\" principle\n**Affected Pages:** AUTO (used throughout codebase)\n\n**Rationale:** The `safeJsonParse` function silently returns a fallback value when JSON parsing fails. While this prevents crashes, it masks data issues that should be surfaced.\n\n**Approach:** In development mode, throw the error. In production, log and return fallback but with clear warning.\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\nexport const safeJsonParse = (jsonString, fallback = null) => {\n  if (!jsonString) return fallback;\n\n  try {\n    return JSON.parse(jsonString);\n  } catch (error) {\n    if (import.meta.env.DEV) {\n      console.warn('JSON parse failed:', error.message);\n    }\n    return fallback;\n  }\n};\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n/**\n * Parse JSON with explicit error handling.\n * In development: throws to surface data issues early.\n * In production: logs error and returns fallback.\n *\n * @param {string} jsonString - JSON string to parse\n * @param {*} fallback - Fallback value on parse failure\n * @param {string} context - Optional context for error messages\n * @returns {*} Parsed JSON or fallback\n * @throws {SyntaxError} In development mode when parsing fails\n */\nexport const safeJsonParse = (jsonString, fallback = null, context = 'safeJsonParse') => {\n  if (!jsonString) return fallback;\n\n  try {\n    return JSON.parse(jsonString);\n  } catch (error) {\n    const errorMessage = `[${context}] JSON parse failed: ${error.message}. Input preview: \"${String(jsonString).slice(0, 100)}...\"`;\n\n    if (import.meta.env.DEV) {\n      // In development, surface the error to catch data issues early\n      throw new SyntaxError(errorMessage);\n    }\n\n    // In production, log warning and return fallback\n    console.error(errorMessage);\n    return fallback;\n  }\n};\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Test in development mode - should throw on malformed JSON\n- [ ] Test in production mode - should log and return fallback\n- [ ] Verify calling code handles potential throws in dev mode\n- [ ] Check that existing functionality isn't broken\n\n~~~~~\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Priority\n\n### Phase 1: Critical Duplication (Highest Impact)\n- **CHUNK 1** - Consolidate DAY_NAMES (affects 8 files, maintenance burden)\n\n### Phase 2: High-Volume Logging (Performance Impact)\n- **CHUNK 10** - AiSignupMarketReport (64 statements - worst offender)\n- **CHUNK 2** - useSearchPageLogic (22 statements on main page)\n- **CHUNK 3** - Header.jsx (27 statements on every page)\n- **CHUNK 4** - SelfListingPage.tsx (31 statements)\n- **CHUNK 5** - useMessagingPageLogic (24 statements)\n\n### Phase 3: Moderate Logging (Quality Improvement)\n- **CHUNK 7** - SignUpLoginModal (24 statements)\n- **CHUNK 8** - useLoggedInAvatarData (19 statements)\n- **CHUNK 9** - useRentalApplicationPageLogic (26 statements)\n- **CHUNK 6** - FavoriteListingsPage (20 statements)\n\n### Phase 4: Architecture Improvement\n- **CHUNK 11** - safeJsonParse error handling\n\n---\n\n## Dependency Graph Impact\n\n| File | Dependents | Risk Level |\n|------|------------|------------|\n| `lib/dayUtils.js` | All day-related components | LOW (adding imports) |\n| `islands/pages/useSearchPageLogic.js` | SearchPage only | LOW |\n| `islands/shared/Header.jsx` | All pages | MEDIUM |\n| `islands/shared/SignUpLoginModal.jsx` | All pages (modal) | MEDIUM |\n| `lib/safeJson.js` | Many files | MEDIUM (behavior change in dev) |\n\n---\n\n## Files Referenced\n\n### Files to Modify\n- `app/src/islands/shared/CreateProposalFlowV2.jsx` (Chunk 1)\n- `app/src/islands/shared/CreateProposalFlowV2Components/DaysSelectionSection.jsx` (Chunk 1)\n- `app/src/islands/pages/AccountProfilePage/useAccountProfilePageLogic.js` (Chunk 1)\n- `app/src/islands/pages/AccountProfilePage/components/PublicView.jsx` (Chunk 1)\n- `app/src/islands/pages/AccountProfilePage/components/cards/ScheduleCommuteCard.jsx` (Chunk 1)\n- `app/src/islands/pages/proposals/ProposalCard.jsx` (Chunk 1)\n- `app/src/logic/workflows/scheduling/validateScheduleWorkflow.js` (Chunk 1)\n- `app/src/logic/workflows/scheduling/validateMoveInDateWorkflow.js` (Chunk 1)\n- `app/src/islands/pages/useSearchPageLogic.js` (Chunk 2)\n- `app/src/islands/shared/Header.jsx` (Chunk 3)\n- `app/src/islands/pages/SelfListingPage/SelfListingPage.tsx` (Chunk 4)\n- `app/src/islands/pages/MessagingPage/useMessagingPageLogic.js` (Chunk 5)\n- `app/src/islands/pages/FavoriteListingsPage/FavoriteListingsPage.jsx` (Chunk 6)\n- `app/src/islands/shared/SignUpLoginModal.jsx` (Chunk 7)\n- `app/src/islands/shared/LoggedInAvatar/useLoggedInAvatarData.js` (Chunk 8)\n- `app/src/islands/pages/useRentalApplicationPageLogic.js` (Chunk 9)\n- `app/src/islands/shared/AiSignupMarketReport/AiSignupMarketReport.jsx` (Chunk 10)\n- `app/src/lib/safeJson.js` (Chunk 11)\n\n### Files with Canonical Exports (No Changes Needed)\n- `app/src/lib/dayUtils.js` - Already exports DAY_NAMES correctly\n- `app/src/lib/constants.js` - Also exports DAY_NAMES (verify single source of truth)\n\n---\n\n## Related Previous Plans\n\nThis plan builds on:\n- `.claude/plans/New/20260118170459_code_refactor_plan.md` - Logic layer refactoring\n- `.claude/plans/New/20260118165142_code_refactor_plan.md` - Initial console logging cleanup\n- `.claude/plans/New/20260118163519_code_refactor_plan.md` - Rules layer refactoring\n\n---\n\n## Metrics\n\n| Metric | Before | After (Expected) |\n|--------|--------|------------------|\n| Console statements in islands | 652 | ~100 (error logging only) |\n| DAY_NAMES definitions | 8 | 1 (canonical export) |\n| Files with silent error swallowing | 144 | ~50 (intentional try-catch) |\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n1. **Console Logging Strategy**: The codebase has 652 console statements in `app/src/islands/` alone. This plan addresses the highest-impact files. A follow-up plan may be needed to address remaining files.\n\n2. **ESLint Configuration**: Consider adding `no-console` rule to `eslint.config.js` to prevent future logging proliferation (with exceptions for console.error).\n\n3. **Error Boundaries**: Many page components lack React Error Boundaries. Consider adding as a separate initiative.\n\n4. **Testing Coverage**: Each chunk should be tested in the development environment before production deployment.\n",
