Duplicate Files (High Priority)\n- **`proposalStages.js`**: Two nearly identical files exist in `lib/constants/` and `logic/constants/`. The logic/ version is more comprehensive and should be the canonical source.\n- **`processProposalData.js`**: Two different implementations in `logic/processors/proposal/` and `logic/processors/proposals/`. The `proposals/` version is more comprehensive.\n- **`ViewSplitLeasePage.jsx`**: Two versions exist - one at root level and one in a subfolder with component extraction.\n\n#### 2. Duplicate Functions (Medium Priority)\n- **`formatDate`**: Found 8+ different implementations across the codebase with slight variations in output format\n- **`formatPrice`/`formatCurrency`**: Multiple implementations in `lib/priceCalculations.js`, `FavoriteListingsPage/formatters.js`, `HostProposalsPage/formatters.js`, and `proposals/displayUtils.js`\n\n#### 3. Debug Code (Low Priority)\n- **`FORCE RELOAD` comments and debug console.logs** in `ViewSplitLeasePage/ViewSplitLeasePage.jsx`\n\n#### 4. Deprecated Re-export Files\n- **`cancelProposalWorkflow.js`** in `workflows/booking/` is marked deprecated but still exists\n\n### Plan Location\n\nThe complete refactoring plan has been saved to:\n**`C:\\Users\\Split Lease\\Documents\\Split Lease\\adws\\.claude\\plans\\New\\20260120183508_code_refactor_plan.md`**\n\n### Key Recommendations\n\n1. **Create centralized `dateFormatters.js`** utility first (CHUNK 10) to enable other consolidations\n2. **Focus on LEAF FILES** (0 dependents) for safest refactoring\n3. **Avoid CRITICAL IMPACT files** like `supabase.js` (93 dependents), `auth.js` (79 dependents), `constants.js` (52 dependents)\n4. **Execute chunks in dependency order** as specified in the plan\n\n### Affected Pages\n\nThe issues affect the following routes:\n- `/view-split-lease` - Duplicate page components, debug logs\n- `/guest-proposals` - Duplicate formatDate/formatCurrency functions\n- `/host-proposals` - Duplicate formatDate/formatCurrency functions  \n- `/favorite-listings` -

DO NOT MODIFY these files:\n| File | Dependents |\n|------|------------|\n| `src\\lib\\supabase.js` | 93 |\n| `src\\lib\\secureStorage.js` | 89 |\n| `src\\lib\\auth.js` | 79 |\n| `src\\lib\\constants.js` | 52 |\n| `src\\lib\\dataLookups.js` | 40 |\n| `src\\logic\\constants\\proposalStatuses.js` | 39 |\n| `src\\islands\\shared\\ErrorBoundary.jsx` | 36 |\n| `src\\styles\\main.css` | 36 |\n| `src\\islands\\shared\\Header.jsx` | 32 |\n| `src\\lib\\config.js` | 32 |\n\n### HIGH IMPACT (15-29 dependents) -

focus on src/ directory\n2. **Identify issues:** Look for:\n   - Performance issues (unnecessary re-renders, missing memoization, inefficient algorithms)\n   - Maintainability issues (complex functions, poor naming, lack of separation of concerns)\n   - Duplication (repeated code patterns, copy-pasted logic)\n   - Anti-patterns (prop drilling, direct DOM manipulation in React, inconsistent error handling)\n   - General issues (dead code, inconsistent formatting, missing types)\n\n3. **For each issue, determine affected pages:**\n   - Trace imports to find which UI pages use this code\n   - List page URLs (e.g., \"/search\", \"/view-split-lease\")\n   - For shared utilities, identify all entry points\n\n4. **Create the refactoring plan** at: .claude/plans/New/20260120183508_code_refactor_plan.md\n\n## Output Format Requirements\n\nThe plan MUST be structured as:\n\n```\n# Code Refactoring Plan -

they're too risky\n2. **Focus on LEAF FILES** (138 files with 0 dependents) - safest to refactor\n3. **Group chunks by PAGE GROUP** - all chunks for same page together\n4. **One chunk = one atomic fix** - don't combine unrelated changes\n5. **Use EXACTLY `~~~~~`** as separator between chunks\n6. **Include BOTH Current Code AND Refactored Code blocks** - mandatory\n7. **Accurate line numbers** - verify before including\n8. **Track cascading changes** - if renaming/moving a symbol, list ALL files that import it\n\n## Pages to Consider\nLook for pages in src/islands/pages/ and correlate with public/*.html files and routes.config.js\n\nStart by exploring the codebase structure, then systematically identify issues, prioritizing leaf files.","agentId":"a0087fb","content":[{"type":"text","text":"I have completed the comprehensive code audit of the `../app` directory.
