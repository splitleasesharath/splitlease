Pure functions with no side effects\n2. **Constants** - Centralized static data\n3. **Processors** (`adapt*`, `format*`, `process*`) - Data transformation layer\n4. **Rules** (`is*`, `can*`, `should*`, `has*`, `determine*`) - Boolean predicates and guards\n5. **Workflows** (`*Workflow`) - Orchestrates calculators + rules + async operations\n\nEach subdomain is independently organized:\n- **auth** - Authentication and session management\n- **booking/proposals** -

Listing search and filtering\n- **user** - User profile and display logic\n\n---\n\n### Key Observations\n\n- **No circular dependencies**: Clear separation between layers (calculators \u2192 rules \u2192 processors \u2192 workflows)\n- **Empty `processors/external`**: Reserved for future external API adapters\n- **Duplicate processors**: `processors/proposal/` and `processors/proposals/` (legacy vs current)\n- **Duplicate workflows**: `workflows/booking/` and `workflows/proposals/` may have overlap (investigate if needed)\n- **68 files total**: Exact match to dependency analysis expectations"

The `processors/proposal/` version is newer with better validation while `processors/proposals/` has more helper functions. Should consolidate into single authoritative version.\n**Approach:** Keep `processors/proposals/processProposalData.js` as canonical (it has formatPrice, formatDate, getEffectiveTerms helpers), merge strict validation from `processors/proposal/`, then delete duplicate and update imports.\n\n**Current Code (processors/proposal/processProposalData.js lines 1-40):**\n```javascript\n/**\n * Process raw proposal data from Supabase into a clean, validated proposal object.\n *\n * @intent Transform raw proposal rows from Supabase into consistent, UI-ready format.\n * @rule NO FALLBACK - Throws explicit errors for missing critical fields.\n * @rule Merges original terms and counteroffer (host-changed) terms into single current terms.\n * @rule Handles dual proposal system (original vs host counteroffer).\n *\n * @param {object} params - Named parameters.\n * @param {object} params.rawProposal - Raw proposal object from Supabase.\n * @param {object} [params.listing] - Processed listing data (if already loaded).\n * @param {object} [params.guest] - Processed guest user data (if already loaded).\n * @param {object} [params.host] - Processed host user data (if already loaded).\n * @returns {object} Clean, validated proposal object with merged terms.\n *\n * @throws {Error} If rawProposal is null/undefined.\n * @throws {Error} If critical _id field is missing.\n * @throws {Error} If Listing or Guest reference is missing.\n *\n * @example\n * const proposal = processProposalData({\n *   rawProposal: {\n *     _id: 'abc123',\n *     Listing: 'listing123',\n *     Guest: 'user456',\n *     'Move-In Date': '2025-01-15',\n *     'Days of Week': [1, 2, 3],\n *     'hc Days of Week': null,\n *     'Proposal Status': 'Host Countered',\n *     ...\n *   }\n * })\n */\nimport { PROPOSAL_STATUSES, getUsualOrder } from '../../constants/proposalStatuses.js'\n\nexport function processProposalData({ rawProposal, listing = null, guest = null, host = null }) {\n  // No Fallback: Proposal data must exist\n  if (!rawProposal) {\n    throw new Error('processProposalData: rawProposal cannot be null or undefined')\n  }\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// DELETE THIS FILE - consolidated into processors/proposals/processProposalData.js\n// All imports should be updated to use:\n// import { processProposalData } from '../logic/processors/proposals/processProposalData.js'\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Run `bun run build` to verify no import errors\n- [ ] Test /my-proposals page loads proposals correctly\n- [ ] Test /view-split-lease page displays proposal details\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 2: Consolidate duplicate cancelProposalWorkflow workflows\n**Files:** `workflows/booking/cancelProposalWorkflow.js`, `workflows/proposals/cancelProposalWorkflow.js`\n**Rationale:** Two workflow files with overlapping cancellation logic. The `booking/` version accepts dependencies as parameters (better testability), while `proposals/` version imports supabase directly.\n**Approach:** Keep `workflows/booking/cancelProposalWorkflow.js` (pure, testable), add missing helper functions from `proposals/`, delete duplicate.\n\n**Current Code (workflows/proposals/cancelProposalWorkflow.js lines 21-24):**\n```javascript\nimport { supabase } from '../../../lib/supabase.js';\nimport { canCancelProposal, requiresSpecialCancellationConfirmation } from '../../rules/proposals/proposalRules.js';\nimport { PROPOSAL_STATUSES } from '../../constants/proposalStatuses.js';\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// DELETE THIS FILE - consolidated into workflows/booking/cancelProposalWorkflow.js\n// The booking/ version accepts supabase as a parameter for better testability\n// Helper functions (determineCancellationCondition, executeDeleteProposal)\n// should be added to workflows/booking/cancelProposalWorkflow.js\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Run `bun run build` to verify no import errors\n- [ ] Test cancel proposal from /my-proposals\n- [ ] Test cancel from Compare Terms modal on /view-split-lease\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 3: Consolidate duplicate canCancelProposal rule functions\n**Files:** `rules/proposals/canCancelProposal.js`, `rules/proposals/proposalRules.js`\n**Rationale:** `canCancelProposal` function exists twice with different signatures: standalone version takes `{proposalStatus, deleted}`, while proposalRules version takes full `proposal` object.\n**Approach:** Keep the standalone `canCancelProposal.js` (cleaner signature), update proposalRules.js to re-export it instead of defining duplicate.\n\n**Current Code (rules/proposals/proposalRules.js lines 26-54):**\n```javascript\n/**\n * Check if a proposal can be cancelled by the guest\n * Based on Bubble.io workflows crkec5, crswt2, crtCg2, curuC4, curuK4, curua4\n *\n * @param {Object} proposal - Proposal object\n * @returns {boolean} True if proposal can be cancelled\n */\nexport function canCancelProposal(proposal) {\n  if (!proposal) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  const status = proposal.status || proposal.Status;\n\n  // Can't cancel if already cancelled or rejected\n  if (\n    status === PROPOSAL_STATUSES.CANCELLED_BY_GUEST.key ||\n    status === PROPOSAL_STATUSES.CANCELLED_BY_SPLITLEASE.key ||\n    status === PROPOSAL_STATUSES.REJECTED_BY_HOST.key\n  ) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  // Can't cancel if lease is already activated\n  if (isCompletedStatus(status)) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  // Can't cancel if expired\n  if (status === PROPOSAL_STATUSES.EXPIRED.key) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  // Otherwise, can cancel\n  return true;\n}\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// Re-export from standalone module for consistency\nimport { canCancelProposal as canCancelProposalStandalone } from './canCancelProposal.js';\n\n/**\n * Check if a proposal can be cancelled by the guest\n * Adapter that extracts status from full proposal object\n *\n * @param {Object} proposal - Proposal object\n * @returns {boolean} True if proposal can be cancelled\n */\nexport function canCancelProposal(proposal) {\n  if (!proposal) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  const status = proposal.status || proposal.Status;\n  const deleted = proposal.Deleted || proposal.deleted || false;\n\n  return canCancelProposalStandalone({ proposalStatus: status, deleted });\n}\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Run `bun run build` to verify no import errors\n- [ ] Test cancel button visibility on /my-proposals\n- [ ] Test cancellation flow on /view-split-lease\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 4: Fix broken import in proposalButtonRules.js\n**File:** `rules/proposals/proposalButtonRules.js`\n**Line:** 1\n**Issue:** Imports from non-existent `../../../config/proposalStatusConfig.js` instead of `../../constants/proposalStatuses.js`.

Both have similar gap-detection logic.\n**Approach:** Keep `calculateCheckInOutDays.js` (more complete with day names), update consumers of `calculateCheckInOutFromDays` to use the consolidated version.\n\n**Current Code (calculateCheckInOutFromDays.js lines 1-41):**\n```javascript\n/**\n * Calculate check-in and check-out days from selected day indices\n * Handles wrap-around scenarios (e.g., Fri-Mon selection)\n *\n * @param {number[]} selectedDays - Array of day indices (0=Sun, 6=Sat)\n * @returns {{ checkIn: number, checkOut: number } | null}\n */\nexport function calculateCheckInOutFromDays(selectedDays) {\n  if (!selectedDays || selectedDays.length < 2) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  const sortedDays = [...selectedDays].sort((a, b) => a - b);\n  const hasSaturday = sortedDays.includes(6);\n  const hasSunday = sortedDays.includes(0);\n  const isWrapAround = hasSaturday && hasSunday && sortedDays.length < 7;\n\n  if (isWrapAround) {\n    // Find the gap to determine actual boundaries\n    let gapIndex = -1;\n    for (let i = 1; i < sortedDays.length; i++) {\n      if (sortedDays[i] - sortedDays[i - 1] > 1) {\n        gapIndex = i;\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n\n    if (gapIndex !== -1) {\n      return {\n        checkIn: sortedDays[gapIndex],\n        checkOut: sortedDays[gapIndex - 1]\n      };\n    }\n  }\n\n  return {\n    checkIn: sortedDays[0],\n    checkOut: sortedDays[sortedDays.length - 1]\n  };\n}\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// DELETE THIS FILE - consolidated into calculateCheckInOutDays.js\n// Consumers should use:\n// import { calculateCheckInOutDays } from './calculateCheckInOutDays.js'\n// And extract just .checkInDay and .checkOutDay if only indices needed\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Run `bun run build` to verify no import errors\n- [ ] Test day selection on /create-proposal shows correct check-in/out\n- [ ] Test wrap-around selection (Fri-Mon) calculates correctly\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 6: Use PRICING_CONSTANTS in calculateFourWeekRent\n**File:** `calculators/pricing/calculateFourWeekRent.js`\n**Line:** 48\n**Issue:** Hardcodes `4` for billing cycle weeks instead of using `PRICING_CONSTANTS.BILLING_CYCLE_WEEKS`. This violates DRY principle and makes future changes error-prone.\n**Affected Pages:** /search (listing cards), /create-proposal (pricing display)\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n  // Pure calculation\n  return nightlyRate * frequency * 4\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\nimport { PRICING_CONSTANTS } from '../../constants/pricingConstants.js'\n\n// ...

This breaks IDE tooltips and documentation generation.\n**Affected Pages:** AUTO (shared utility)\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n/**\n * Check if selected days form a contiguous block.\n * Handles week wrap-around cases (e.g., Fri-Mon).\n *\n * @.claude\\plans\\Deprecated\\Context\\Option Sets\\ZEP - Curation Parameters(OS).md {number[]} selectedDays - Array of day indices (0-6).\n * @returns {boolean} True if days are contiguous.\n */\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n/**\n * Check if selected days form a contiguous block.\n * Handles week wrap-around cases (e.g., Fri-Mon).\n *\n * @param {number[]} selectedDays - Array of day indices (0-6).\n * @returns {boolean} True if days are contiguous.\n */\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Run `bun run build` to verify no errors\n- [ ] Verify IDE shows correct param tooltip\n- [ ] Test contiguous selection validation works\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 8: Add barrel exports for logic layer\n**File:** `index.js` (NEW FILE - create at app/src/logic/index.js)\n**Line:** N/A (new file)\n**Issue:** No centralized barrel export for the logic layer.

Should consolidate into single authoritative version.\n**Approach:** Keep `processors/proposals/processProposalData.js` as canonical (it has formatPrice, formatDate, getEffectiveTerms helpers), merge strict validation from `processors/proposal/`, then delete duplicate and update imports.\n\n**Current Code (processors/proposal/processProposalData.js lines 1-40):**\n```javascript\n/**\n * Process raw proposal data from Supabase into a clean, validated proposal object.\n *\n * @intent Transform raw proposal rows from Supabase into consistent, UI-ready format.\n * @rule NO FALLBACK - Throws explicit errors for missing critical fields.\n * @rule Merges original terms and counteroffer (host-changed) terms into single current terms.\n * @rule Handles dual proposal system (original vs host counteroffer).\n *\n * @param {object} params - Named parameters.\n * @param {object} params.rawProposal - Raw proposal object from Supabase.\n * @param {object} [params.listing] - Processed listing data (if already loaded).\n * @param {object} [params.guest] - Processed guest user data (if already loaded).\n * @param {object} [params.host] - Processed host user data (if already loaded).\n * @returns {object} Clean, validated proposal object with merged terms.\n *\n * @throws {Error} If rawProposal is null/undefined.\n * @throws {Error} If critical _id field is missing.\n * @throws {Error} If Listing or Guest reference is missing.\n *\n * @example\n * const proposal = processProposalData({\n *   rawProposal: {\n *     _id: 'abc123',\n *     Listing: 'listing123',\n *     Guest: 'user456',\n *     'Move-In Date': '2025-01-15',\n *     'Days of Week': [1, 2, 3],\n *     'hc Days of Week': null,\n *     'Proposal Status': 'Host Countered',\n *     ...\n *   }\n * })\n */\nimport { PROPOSAL_STATUSES, getUsualOrder } from '../../constants/proposalStatuses.js'\n\nexport function processProposalData({ rawProposal, listing = null, guest = null, host = null }) {\n  // No Fallback: Proposal data must exist\n  if (!rawProposal) {\n    throw new Error('processProposalData: rawProposal cannot be null or undefined')\n  }\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// DELETE THIS FILE - consolidated into processors/proposals/processProposalData.js\n// All imports should be updated to use:\n// import { processProposalData } from '../logic/processors/proposals/processProposalData.js'\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Run `bun run build` to verify no import errors\n- [ ] Test /my-proposals page loads proposals correctly\n- [ ] Test /view-split-lease page displays proposal details\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 2: Consolidate duplicate cancelProposalWorkflow workflows\n**Files:** `workflows/booking/cancelProposalWorkflow.js`, `workflows/proposals/cancelProposalWorkflow.js`\n**Rationale:** Two workflow files with overlapping cancellation logic. The `booking/` version accepts dependencies as parameters (better testability), while `proposals/` version imports supabase directly.\n**Approach:** Keep `workflows/booking/cancelProposalWorkflow.js` (pure, testable), add missing helper functions from `proposals/`, delete duplicate.\n\n**Current Code (workflows/proposals/cancelProposalWorkflow.js lines 21-24):**\n```javascript\nimport { supabase } from '../../../lib/supabase.js';\nimport { canCancelProposal, requiresSpecialCancellationConfirmation } from '../../rules/proposals/proposalRules.js';\nimport { PROPOSAL_STATUSES } from '../../constants/proposalStatuses.js';\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// DELETE THIS FILE - consolidated into workflows/booking/cancelProposalWorkflow.js\n// The booking/ version accepts supabase as a parameter for better testability\n// Helper functions (determineCancellationCondition, executeDeleteProposal)\n// should be added to workflows/booking/cancelProposalWorkflow.js\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Run `bun run build` to verify no import errors\n- [ ] Test cancel proposal from /my-proposals\n- [ ] Test cancel from Compare Terms modal on /view-split-lease\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 3: Consolidate duplicate canCancelProposal rule functions\n**Files:** `rules/proposals/canCancelProposal.js`, `rules/proposals/proposalRules.js`\n**Rationale:** `canCancelProposal` function exists twice with different signatures: standalone version takes `{proposalStatus, deleted}`, while proposalRules version takes full `proposal` object.\n**Approach:** Keep the standalone `canCancelProposal.js` (cleaner signature), update proposalRules.js to re-export it instead of defining duplicate.\n\n**Current Code (rules/proposals/proposalRules.js lines 26-54):**\n```javascript\n/**\n * Check if a proposal can be cancelled by the guest\n * Based on Bubble.io workflows crkec5, crswt2, crtCg2, curuC4, curuK4, curua4\n *\n * @param {Object} proposal - Proposal object\n * @returns {boolean} True if proposal can be cancelled\n */\nexport function canCancelProposal(proposal) {\n  if (!proposal) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  const status = proposal.status || proposal.Status;\n\n  // Can't cancel if already cancelled or rejected\n  if (\n    status === PROPOSAL_STATUSES.CANCELLED_BY_GUEST.key ||\n    status === PROPOSAL_STATUSES.CANCELLED_BY_SPLITLEASE.key ||\n    status === PROPOSAL_STATUSES.REJECTED_BY_HOST.key\n  ) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  // Can't cancel if lease is already activated\n  if (isCompletedStatus(status)) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  // Can't cancel if expired\n  if (status === PROPOSAL_STATUSES.EXPIRED.key) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  // Otherwise, can cancel\n  return true;\n}\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// Re-export from standalone module for consistency\nimport { canCancelProposal as canCancelProposalStandalone } from './canCancelProposal.js';\n\n/**\n * Check if a proposal can be cancelled by the guest\n * Adapter that extracts status from full proposal object\n *\n * @param {Object} proposal - Proposal object\n * @returns {boolean} True if proposal can be cancelled\n */\nexport function canCancelProposal(proposal) {\n  if (!proposal) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  const status = proposal.status || proposal.Status;\n  const deleted = proposal.Deleted || proposal.deleted || false;\n\n  return canCancelProposalStandalone({ proposalStatus: status, deleted });\n}\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Run `bun run build` to verify no import errors\n- [ ] Test cancel button visibility on /my-proposals\n- [ ] Test cancellation flow on /view-split-lease\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 4: Fix broken import in proposalButtonRules.js\n**File:** `rules/proposals/proposalButtonRules.js`\n**Line:** 1\n**Issue:** Imports from non-existent `../../../config/proposalStatusConfig.js` instead of `../../constants/proposalStatuses.js`. This is a critical bug that would cause runtime errors.\n**Affected Pages:** /my-proposals (proposal cards with buttons)\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\nimport { getStatusConfig, PROPOSAL_STATUS } from '../../../config/proposalStatusConfig.js';\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\nimport { getStatusConfig, PROPOSAL_STATUSES as PROPOSAL_STATUS } from '../../constants/proposalStatuses.js';\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Run `bun run build` to verify import resolves\n- [ ] Test proposal card buttons render on /my-proposals\n- [ ] Test button states change correctly based on proposal status\n\n~~~~~\n\n## PAGE GROUP: /search, /create-proposal (Chunks: 5, 6)\n\n### CHUNK 5: Consolidate duplicate check-in/out calculation functions\n**Files:** `calculators/scheduling/calculateCheckInOutDays.js`, `calculators/scheduling/calculateCheckInOutFromDays.js`\n**Rationale:** Two functions performing similar wrap-around detection for check-in/out days. `calculateCheckInOutDays` returns day names, `calculateCheckInOutFromDays` returns only indices. Both have similar gap-detection logic.\n**Approach:** Keep `calculateCheckInOutDays.js` (more complete with day names), update consumers of `calculateCheckInOutFromDays` to use the consolidated version.\n\n**Current Code (calculateCheckInOutFromDays.js lines 1-41):**\n```javascript\n/**\n * Calculate check-in and check-out days from selected day indices\n * Handles wrap-around scenarios (e.g., Fri-Mon selection)\n *\n * @param {number[]} selectedDays - Array of day indices (0=Sun, 6=Sat)\n * @returns {{ checkIn: number, checkOut: number } | null}\n */\nexport function calculateCheckInOutFromDays(selectedDays) {\n  if (!selectedDays || selectedDays.length < 2) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  const sortedDays = [...selectedDays].sort((a, b) => a - b);\n  const hasSaturday = sortedDays.includes(6);\n  const hasSunday = sortedDays.includes(0);\n  const isWrapAround = hasSaturday && hasSunday && sortedDays.length < 7;\n\n  if (isWrapAround) {\n    // Find the gap to determine actual boundaries\n    let gapIndex = -1;\n    for (let i = 1; i < sortedDays.length; i++) {\n      if (sortedDays[i] - sortedDays[i - 1] > 1) {\n        gapIndex = i;\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n\n    if (gapIndex !== -1) {\n      return {\n        checkIn: sortedDays[gapIndex],\n        checkOut: sortedDays[gapIndex - 1]\n      };\n    }\n  }\n\n  return {\n    checkIn: sortedDays[0],\n    checkOut: sortedDays[sortedDays.length - 1]\n  };\n}\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// DELETE THIS FILE - consolidated into calculateCheckInOutDays.js\n// Consumers should use:\n// import { calculateCheckInOutDays } from './calculateCheckInOutDays.js'\n// And extract just .checkInDay and .checkOutDay if only indices needed\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Run `bun run build` to verify no import errors\n- [ ] Test day selection on /create-proposal shows correct check-in/out\n- [ ] Test wrap-around selection (Fri-Mon) calculates correctly\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 6: Use PRICING_CONSTANTS in calculateFourWeekRent\n**File:** `calculators/pricing/calculateFourWeekRent.js`\n**Line:** 48\n**Issue:** Hardcodes `4` for billing cycle weeks instead of using `PRICING_CONSTANTS.BILLING_CYCLE_WEEKS`. This violates DRY principle and makes future changes error-prone.\n**Affected Pages:** /search (listing cards), /create-proposal (pricing display)\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n  // Pure calculation\n  return nightlyRate * frequency * 4\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\nimport { PRICING_CONSTANTS } from '../../constants/pricingConstants.js'\n\n// ... (at function top, add import)\n\n  // Pure calculation using centralized constant\n  return nightlyRate * frequency * PRICING_CONSTANTS.BILLING_CYCLE_WEEKS\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Run `bun run build` to verify no errors\n- [ ] Test listing card prices on /search match expected values\n- [ ] Test pricing breakdown on /create-proposal\n\n~~~~~\n\n## PAGE GROUP: AUTO (Chunks: 7, 8)\n\n### CHUNK 7: Fix malformed JSDoc in isContiguousSelection\n**File:** `calculators/scheduling/isContiguousSelection.js`\n**Line:** 5\n**Issue:** JSDoc `@param` annotation contains corrupted path reference instead of proper type. This breaks IDE tooltips and documentation generation.\n**Affected Pages:** AUTO (shared utility)\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n/**\n * Check if selected days form a contiguous block.\n * Handles week wrap-around cases (e.g., Fri-Mon).\n *\n * @.claude\\plans\\Deprecated\\Context\\Option Sets\\ZEP - Curation Parameters(OS).md {number[]} selectedDays - Array of day indices (0-6).\n * @returns {boolean} True if days are contiguous.\n */\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n/**\n * Check if selected days form a contiguous block.\n * Handles week wrap-around cases (e.g., Fri-Mon).\n *\n * @param {number[]} selectedDays - Array of day indices (0-6).\n * @returns {boolean} True if days are contiguous.\n */\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Run `bun run build` to verify no errors\n- [ ] Verify IDE shows correct param tooltip\n- [ ] Test contiguous selection validation works\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 8: Add barrel exports for logic layer\n**File:** `index.js` (NEW FILE - create at app/src/logic/index.js)\n**Line:** N/A (new file)\n**Issue:** No centralized barrel export for the logic layer. Consumers must know exact paths to import individual modules. A barrel export improves discoverability and simplifies imports.\n**Affected Pages:** All pages using logic functions\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n// No index.js exists - consumers must use full paths:\n// import { calculateFourWeekRent } from '../logic/calculators/pricing/calculateFourWeekRent.js'\n// import { canCancelProposal } from '../logic/rules/proposals/canCancelProposal.js'\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n/**\n * Logic Layer Barrel Exports\n *\n * Provides centralized access to all business logic functions.\n * Organized by domain for discoverability.\n */\n\n// ============================================================================\n// CALCULATORS\n// ============================================================================\n\n// Pricing\nexport { calculateFourWeekRent } from './calculators/pricing/calculateFourWeekRent.js';\nexport { calculatePricingBreakdown } from './calculators/pricing/calculatePricingBreakdown.js';\nexport { calculateReservationTotal } from './calculators/pricing/calculateReservationTotal.js';\nexport { getNightlyRateByFrequency } from './calculators/pricing/getNightlyRateByFrequency.js';\nexport { calculateGuestFacingPrice } from './calculators/pricing/calculateGuestFacingPrice.js';\n\n// Scheduling\nexport { calculateCheckInOutDays } from './calculators/scheduling/calculateCheckInOutDays.js';\nexport { calculateNightsFromDays } from './calculators/scheduling/calculateNightsFromDays.js';\nexport { calculateNextAvailableCheckIn } from './calculators/scheduling/calculateNextAvailableCheckIn.js';\nexport { isContiguousSelection } from './calculators/scheduling/isContiguousSelection.js';\n\n// Reviews\nexport { calculateFormCompletion } from './calculators/reviews/calculateFormCompletion.js';\nexport { calculateReviewScore } from './calculators/reviews/calculateReviewScore.js';\n\n// ============================================================================\n// CONSTANTS\n// ============================================================================\n\nexport { PRICING_CONSTANTS } from './constants/pricingConstants.js';\nexport { PROPOSAL_STAGES } from './constants/proposalStages.js';\nexport { PROPOSAL_STATUSES, getStatusConfig, isTerminalStatus, isCompletedStatus } from './constants/proposalStatuses.js';\nexport { REVIEW_CATEGORIES, REVIEW_CATEGORY_COUNT, RATING_SCALE_LABELS } from './constants/reviewCategories.js';\nexport { PRICE_TIERS, SORT_OPTIONS, WEEK_PATTERNS } from './constants/searchConstants.js';\n\n// ============================================================================\n// RULES\n// ============================================================================\n\n// Proposals\nexport { canAcceptProposal } from './rules/proposals/canAcceptProposal.js';\nexport { canCancelProposal } from './rules/proposals/canCancelProposal.js';\nexport { canEditProposal } from './rules/proposals/canEditProposal.js';\n\n// Auth\nexport { isProtectedPage } from './rules/auth/isProtectedPage.js';\nexport { isSessionValid } from './rules/auth/isSessionValid.js';\n\n// Users\nexport { isGuest } from './rules/users/isGuest.js';\nexport { isHost } from './rules/users/isHost.js';\nexport { hasProfilePhoto } from './rules/users/hasProfilePhoto.js';\n\n// ============================================================================\n// PROCESSORS\n// ============================================================================\n\nexport { processProposalData, getEffectiveTerms, formatPrice, formatDate } from './processors/proposals/processProposalData.js';\nexport { formatHostName } from './processors/display/formatHostName.js';\nexport { processUserData } from './processors/user/processUserData.js';\nexport { processUserDisplayName } from './processors/user/processUserDisplayName.js';\n\n// ============================================================================\n// WORKFLOWS\n// ============================================================================\n\nexport { cancelProposalWorkflow } from './workflows/booking/cancelProposalWorkflow.js';\nexport { checkAuthStatusWorkflow } from './workflows/auth/checkAuthStatusWorkflow.js';\nexport { validateScheduleWorkflow } from './workflows/scheduling/validateScheduleWorkflow.js';\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Run `bun run build` to verify barrel export compiles\n- [ ] Test importing via `import { calculateFourWeekRent } from '../logic'`\n- [ ] Verify tree-shaking works (unused exports not bundled)\n\n~~~~~\n\n## Implementation Order\n\nBased on dependency analysis and topological levels:\n\n1. **Chunk 7** -
