Both ProposalCard and ExpandableProposalCard also define their own `DAY_NAMES` locally.\n- **Approach**:\n  1. Update `displayUtils.js` to import `DAY_NAMES` from `lib/dayUtils.js` and create derived `DAY_ABBREVS_SHORT` (3-letter) locally\n  2. Remove local `DAY_NAMES` from ProposalCard.jsx and ExpandableProposalCard.jsx, import from `lib/dayUtils.js`\n  3. Keep `DAY_ABBREVS` in displayUtils.js as it's a 1-letter abbreviation not available elsewhere\n\n~~~~~\n\n## Chunk 2 of 6\n- **Files**: `src/islands/pages/AccountProfilePage/useAccountProfilePageLogic.js`, `src/islands/pages/AccountProfilePage/components/PublicView.jsx`, `src/islands/pages/AccountProfilePage/components/cards/ScheduleCommuteCard.jsx`\n- **Rationale**: All three files define their own `DAY_NAMES` constant locally instead of importing from the centralized `lib/dayUtils.js` or `lib/constants.js`\n- **Approach**:\n  1. Remove local `DAY_NAMES` declarations from all three files\n  2. Add import `{ DAY_NAMES } from '../../../lib/dayUtils.js'` (adjust path per file depth)\n  3. No logic changes required - just import consolidation\n\n~~~~~\n\n## Chunk 3 of 6\n- **Files**: `src/logic/workflows/scheduling/validateScheduleWorkflow.js`, `src/logic/workflows/scheduling/validateMoveInDateWorkflow.js`\n- **Rationale**: Both workflow files define `DAY_NAMES` locally inside functions instead of importing from centralized location\n- **Approach**:\n  1. Add import `{ DAY_NAMES } from '../../../lib/dayUtils.js'` to both files\n  2. Remove local `const DAY_NAMES = [...]` declarations from inside functions\n  3. No logic changes - just import consolidation\n\n~~~~~\n\n## Chunk 4 of 6\n- **Files**: `src/islands/shared/CreateProposalFlowV2Components/DaysSelectionSection.jsx`\n- **Rationale**: Defines its own local `DAY_NAMES` constant at line 10 instead of importing\n- **Approach**:\n  1. Add import `{ DAY_NAMES } from '../../../lib/dayUtils.js'`\n  2. Remove local `const DAY_NAMES = [...]` declaration\n  3. No logic changes required\n\n~~~~~\n\n## Chunk 5 of 6\n- **Files**: `src/logic/processors/proposal/processProposalData.js`, `src/logic/processors/proposals/processProposalData.js`\n- **Rationale**: Two separate files exist with overlapping but different implementations. `proposal/` (singular) has 1 dependent, `proposals/` (plural) has 0 dependents but is the canonical location per the comment in `loadProposalDetailsWorkflow.js`\n- **Approach**:\n  1. Keep `proposals/processProposalData.js` as canonical (matches workflow import pattern)\n  2. Update `proposal/processProposalData.js` to re-export from canonical location with deprecation notice\n  3. Add any unique exports from `proposal/` to `proposals/` if needed\n\n~~~~~\n\n## Chunk 6 of 6\n- **Files**: `src/lib/constants/proposalStatuses.js`, `src/lib/constants/proposalStages.js`\n- **Rationale**: These files are marked as deprecated and re-export from `logic/constants/`. They add unnecessary indirection and confusion about canonical import paths\n- **Approach**:\n  1.

Both ProposalCard and ExpandableProposalCard also define their own `DAY_NAMES` locally.\n- **Approach**:\n  1. Update `displayUtils.js` to import `DAY_NAMES` from `lib/dayUtils.js` and create derived `DAY_ABBREVS_SHORT` (3-letter) locally\n  2. Remove local `DAY_NAMES` from ProposalCard.jsx and ExpandableProposalCard.jsx, import from `lib/dayUtils.js`\n  3. Keep `DAY_ABBREVS` in displayUtils.js as it's a 1-letter abbreviation not available elsewhere\n\n~~~~~\n\n## Chunk 2 of 6\n- **Files**: `src/islands/pages/AccountProfilePage/useAccountProfilePageLogic.js`, `src/islands/pages/AccountProfilePage/components/PublicView.jsx`, `src/islands/pages/AccountProfilePage/components/cards/ScheduleCommuteCard.jsx`\n- **Rationale**: All three files define their own `DAY_NAMES` constant locally instead of importing from the centralized `lib/dayUtils.js` or `lib/constants.js`\n- **Approach**:\n  1. Remove local `DAY_NAMES` declarations from all three files\n  2. Add import `{ DAY_NAMES } from '../../../lib/dayUtils.js'` (adjust path per file depth)\n  3. No logic changes required - just import consolidation\n\n~~~~~\n\n## Chunk 3 of 6\n- **Files**: `src/logic/workflows/scheduling/validateScheduleWorkflow.js`, `src/logic/workflows/scheduling/validateMoveInDateWorkflow.js`\n- **Rationale**: Both workflow files define `DAY_NAMES` locally inside functions instead of importing from centralized location\n- **Approach**:\n  1. Add import `{ DAY_NAMES } from '../../../lib/dayUtils.js'` to both files\n  2. Remove local `const DAY_NAMES = [...]` declarations from inside functions\n  3. No logic changes - just import consolidation\n\n~~~~~\n\n## Chunk 4 of 6\n- **Files**: `src/islands/shared/CreateProposalFlowV2Components/DaysSelectionSection.jsx`\n- **Rationale**: Defines its own local `DAY_NAMES` constant at line 10 instead of importing\n- **Approach**:\n  1. Add import `{ DAY_NAMES } from '../../../lib/dayUtils.js'`\n  2. Remove local `const DAY_NAMES = [...]` declaration\n  3. No logic changes required\n\n~~~~~\n\n## Chunk 5 of 6\n- **Files**: `src/logic/processors/proposal/processProposalData.js`, `src/logic/processors/proposals/processProposalData.js`\n- **Rationale**: Two separate files exist with overlapping but different implementations. `proposal/` (singular) has 1 dependent, `proposals/` (plural) has 0 dependents but is the canonical location per the comment in `loadProposalDetailsWorkflow.js`\n- **Approach**:\n  1. Keep `proposals/processProposalData.js` as canonical (matches workflow import pattern)\n  2. Update `proposal/processProposalData.js` to re-export from canonical location with deprecation notice\n  3. Add any unique exports from `proposal/` to `proposals/` if needed\n\n~~~~~\n\n## Chunk 6 of 6\n- **Files**: `src/lib/constants/proposalStatuses.js`, `src/lib/constants/proposalStages.js`\n- **Rationale**: These files are marked as deprecated and re-export from `logic/constants/`. They add unnecessary indirection and confusion about canonical import paths\n- **Approach**:\n  1. Find all imports using `lib/constants/proposalStatuses.js` path (1 file: `lib/proposals/statusButtonConfig.js`)\n  2. Update imports to use canonical `logic/constants/proposalStatuses.js` path\n  3.
