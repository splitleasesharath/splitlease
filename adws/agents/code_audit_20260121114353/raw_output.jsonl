Indexing Convention\n[INTERNAL]: JavaScript 0-6 (Sunday=0, Monday=1, ..., Saturday=6)\n[BUBBLE_API]: Bubble 1-7 (Sunday=1, Monday=2, ..., Saturday=7)\n[CONVERSION]: ALWAYS use adaptDaysFromBubble/adaptDaysToBubble at boundaries\n[LOCATION]: logic/processors/external/\n\n```javascript\nimport { adaptDaysFromBubble } from 'logic/processors/external/adaptDaysFromBubble.js';\nimport { adaptDaysToBubble } from 'logic/processors/external/adaptDaysToBubble.js';\n\n// Receiving from Bubble API\nconst jsDays = adaptDaysFromBubble({ bubbleDays: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] }); // → [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n// Sending to Bubble API\nconst bubbleDays = adaptDaysToBubble({ jsDays: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] }); // → [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\n### Hollow Component Pattern\n[DESCRIPTION]: UI component delegates ALL logic to custom hook\n[COMPONENT]: Contains only JSX rendering\n[HOOK]: Contains all state, effects, handlers\n[BENEFIT]: Testable logic, focused rendering, reusable logic\n\n```javascript\n// islands/pages/ViewSplitLeasePage.jsx\nexport default function ViewSplitLeasePage() {\n  const logic = useViewSplitLeasePageLogic();\n  return <div>{/* Pure JSX using logic.* */}</div>;\n}\n\n// islands/pages/useViewSplitLeasePageLogic.js\nexport function useViewSplitLeasePageLogic() {\n  // ALL state, effects, handlers here\n  return { /* exported API */ };\n}\n```\n\n### Secure Storage Pattern\n[DESCRIPTION]: Encrypt sensitive data in localStorage\n[USED_FOR]: Auth tokens, session IDs\n[ENCRYPTION]: AES encryption\n\n```javascript\nimport { setSecureItem, getSecureItem, removeSecureItem } from 'lib/secureStorage.js';\n\n// Store encrypted\nsetSecureItem('splitlease_auth_token', token);\n\n// Retrieve and decrypt\nconst token = getSecureItem('splitlease_auth_token');\n\n// Remove\nremoveSecureItem('splitlease_auth_token');\n```\n\n### API Proxy Pattern\n[DESCRIPTION]: All Bubble API calls go through Supabase Edge Functions\n[REASON]: Keep API keys server-side\n[NEVER]: Call Bubble API directly from frontend\n\n```javascript\nimport { bubbleAPI } from 'lib/bubbleAPI.js';\n\n// Proxied through Edge Function\nconst listing = await bubbleAPI.getListing(listingId);\n```\n\n---\n\n## IMPORT_ALIASES\n\n[ALIAS]: logic/* → C:\\Users\\Split Lease\\Documents\\Split Lease\\app\\src\\logic/*\n[ALIAS]: lib/* → C:\\Users\\Split Lease\\Documents\\Split Lease\\app\\src\\lib/*\n[ALIAS]: islands/* → C:\\Users\\Split Lease\\Documents\\Split Lease\\app\\src\\islands/*\n[ALIAS]: styles/* → C:\\Users\\Split Lease\\Documents\\Split Lease\\app\\src\\styles/*\n\n```javascript\n// Use absolute imports from src/\nimport { calculateFourWeekRent } from 'logic/calculators/pricing/calculateFourWeekRent.js';\nimport { checkAuthStatus } from 'lib/auth.js';\nimport Button from 'islands/shared/Button.jsx';\n```\n\n---\n\n## KEY_DATA_FLOWS\n\n### Authentication Flow\n[ENTRY]: User submits login form\n[STEP_1]: lib/auth.js → loginUser()\n[STEP_2]: Supabase Edge Function auth-user\n[STEP_3]: Bubble API validates credentials\n[STEP_4]: Token stored via lib/secureStorage.js\n[STEP_5]: User type stored (Host/Guest)\n[EXIT]: Redirect to dashboard\n\n### Proposal Creation Flow\n[ENTRY]: Guest clicks \"Book\" on listing\n[STEP_1]: islands/shared/CreateProposalFlowV2.jsx modal opens\n[STEP_2]: User selects days (uses day conversion)\n[STEP_3]: logic/calculators/pricing calculates prices\n[STEP_4]: logic/rules/proposals validates proposal\n[STEP_5]: logic/workflows/proposals orchestrates submission\n[STEP_6]: Supabase Edge Function → Bubble API\n[EXIT]: Redirect to guest-proposals page\n\n### Listing Search Flow\n[ENTRY]: User visits /search\n[STEP_1]: islands/pages/SearchPage.jsx renders\n[STEP_2]: User sets filters (days, price, location)\n[STEP_3]: lib/dataLookups.js fetches listings from Supabase\n[STEP_4]: logic/rules/search validates filters\n[STEP_5]: islands/shared/GoogleMap.jsx displays results\n[EXIT]: User clicks listing → /view-split-lease/:id\n\n---\n\n## SUBDIRECTORY_DOCUMENTATION\n\n[islands/CLAUDE.md]: Component library documentation\n[logic/CLAUDE.md]: Four-layer logic documentation\n[lib/CLAUDE.md]: Utilities and API clients documentation\n[styles/CLAUDE.md]: Styling conventions and CSS documentation\n\n---\n\n## USAGE_NOTES\n\n### When Adding New Page\n1. Create HTML file in app/public/\n2. Create JSX entry point in app/src/\n3. Create page component in app/src/islands/pages/\n4. Create logic hook in app/src/islands/pages/use*PageLogic.js\n5. Add route to routes.config.js\n6. Run: bun run generate-routes\n\n### When Adding Business Logic\n1. Determine layer: calculator, rule, processor, or workflow\n2. Create file in appropriate logic/* subdirectory\n3. Follow naming convention for layer\n4. Write pure function with single responsibility\n5. Export from layer's index.js\n\n### When Adding API Call\n1. Add function to lib/bubbleAPI.js or lib/supabase.js\n2. Use Edge Function proxy for Bubble API\n3. Add error handling\n4. Use secure storage for tokens\n\n### When Converting Days\n1. Identify system boundary (Bubble API ↔ Internal)\n2. Use adaptDaysFromBubble when receiving from Bubble\n3. Use adaptDaysToBubble when sending to Bubble\n4. NEVER mix 0-based and 1-based in same function\n\n---\n\n## CRITICAL_FILES\n\n### Must Read Before Changes\n[FILE]: routes.config.js - Route definitions\n[FILE]: lib/constants.js - All configuration\n[FILE]: lib/auth.js - Authentication system\n[FILE]: logic/processors/external/adaptDays*.js - Day conversion\n\n### Don't Modify\n[DIR]: routes/ - Auto-generated\n[FILE]: Any file in logic/ without understanding four-layer pattern\n\n---\n\n## METRICS\n\n[ENTRY_POINTS]: 29\n[LOGIC_FILES]: 57\n[LIB_FILES]: 24\n[TOTAL_FILES]: 150+\n[CALCULATORS]: 9\n[RULES]: 22\n[PROCESSORS]: 14\n[WORKFLOWS]: 12\n[CSS_FILES]: 10+ global\n[ROUTES]: 30+\n\n---\n\n**VERSION**: 5.0\n**LAST_UPDATED**: 2025-12-11\n**MAINTAINER**: Claude Code\n","numLines":747,"startLine":1,"totalLines":747}}}

Key aspects:\n\n### Architecture\n- **Islands Architecture**: Each page is an independent React root (27 HTML entry points → JSX → Page components)\n- **Hollow Component Pattern**: Page components delegate all logic to `use*PageLogic` hooks\n- **Four-Layer Logic Architecture**: `calculators/` → `rules/` → `processors/` → `workflows/`\n- **Route Registry**: Single source of truth in `routes.config.js`\n\n### Tech Stack\n- Frontend: React 18, Vite 5, Supabase client\n- Backend: Supabase Edge Functions (Deno/TypeScript)\n- Deployment: Cloudflare Pages\n- State: Local state (useState), URL params, localStorage\n\n### Critical Files (HIGH IMPACT - 30+ dependents)\n- `src/lib/supabase.js` (99 dependents)\n- `src/lib/auth.js` (90 dependents)\n- `src/lib/secureStorage.js` (89 dependents)\n- `src/lib/constants.js` (52 dependents)\n- `src/islands/shared/ErrorBoundary.jsx` (41 dependents)\n- `src/lib/dataLookups.js` (41 dependents)\n\n### Key Patterns\n- Day indexing: JS 0-6 (Sunday=0), with conversion at API boundaries\n- Secure storage for auth tokens\n- API proxy pattern (all external calls via Edge Functions)\n\nNow let me use the Explore agent to perform a comprehensive code audit for general improvements:"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":16207,"cache_read_input_tokens":76139,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":16207,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"16253630-5f78-4790-b775-8888ad8db598","uuid":"ad6c5771-91e3-400d-ac4a-c8f2e5258fd0"}
