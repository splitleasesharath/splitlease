This causes code duplication and potential inconsistency.\n**Affected Pages:** /search, /view-split-lease (via useScheduleSelectorLogicCore.js)\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n// calculators/scheduling/isContiguousSelection.js\nexport function isContiguousSelection(selectedDays) {\n  if (!selectedDays || selectedDays.length === 0) return false;\n  if (selectedDays.length === 1) return true;\n  if (selectedDays.length >= 6) return true;\n\n  const sorted = [...selectedDays].sort((a, b) => a - b);\n  const isStandardContiguous = sorted.every((day, i) => i === 0 || day === sorted[i - 1] + 1);\n  if (isStandardContiguous) return true;\n\n  // Wrap-around check\n  const hasZero = sorted.includes(0);\n  const hasSix = sorted.includes(6);\n  if (hasZero && hasSix) {\n    const allDays = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];\n    const notSelectedDays = allDays.filter(d => !sorted.includes(d));\n\n    const minNotSelected = Math.min(...notSelectedDays);\n    const maxNotSelected = Math.max(...notSelectedDays);\n\n    return notSelectedDays.length === (maxNotSelected - minNotSelected + 1);\n  }\n\n  return false;\n}\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// DELETE calculators/scheduling/isContiguousSelection.js entirely\n// Update all imports to use the canonical implementation:\n// import { isScheduleContiguous } from '../../logic/rules/scheduling/isScheduleContiguous.js'\n\n// If you need a simpler API without object parameter, add a wrapper:\n// In rules/scheduling/isScheduleContiguous.js, add at the bottom:\n/**\n * Simple wrapper for backward compatibility.\n * @deprecated Use isScheduleContiguous({ selectedDayIndices }) instead\n */\nexport function isContiguousSelection(selectedDays) {\n  if (!selectedDays || !Array.isArray(selectedDays)) return false;\n  return isScheduleContiguous({ selectedDayIndices: selectedDays });\n}\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Update imports in `useScheduleSelectorLogicCore.js` to use canonical `isScheduleContiguous`\n- [ ] Remove `calculators/scheduling/isContiguousSelection.js`\n- [ ] Run schedule selector tests with wrap-around cases (Fri-Sun, Sat-Tue)\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 2: Duplicate processProposalData implementations\n**Files:** `processors/proposal/processProposalData.js`, `processors/proposals/processProposalData.js`\n**Line:** Full files\n**Issue:** Two different `processProposalData` implementations exist in different directories (`proposal/` singular vs `proposals/` plural). This causes confusion and potential bugs if the wrong one is imported. They have different field mappings and processing logic.\n**Affected Pages:** /guest-proposals, /view-split-lease, /host-proposals\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n// processors/proposal/processProposalData.js (149 lines)\n// Uses: Move-In Date, Days of Week, hc Move-In Date, etc.\nexport function processProposalData({ rawProposal, listing, guest, host }) {\n  // Returns: { id, listingId, guestId, status, deleted, usualOrder, currentTerms, originalTerms, ... }\n}\n\n// processors/proposals/processProposalData.js (301 lines)\n// Uses: Days Selected, Nights Selected, proposal nightly price, etc.\nexport function processProposalData(rawProposal) {\n  // Returns: { id, _id, status, deleted, daysSelected, nightsSelected, totalPrice, ... }\n}\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// STEP 1: Consolidate into processors/proposals/processProposalData.js (the more complete one)\n// STEP 2: Add the field mappings from proposal/processProposalData.js as an alias function\n\n// In processors/proposals/processProposalData.js, add:\n/**\n * Alternative processor for workflows that need the currentTerms/originalTerms format.\n * @param {object} params - { rawProposal, listing, guest, host }\n * @returns {object} Proposal with merged terms\n */\nexport function processProposalDataWithTerms({ rawProposal, listing = null, guest = null, host = null }) {\n  // Core processing from existing processProposalData\n  const base = processProposalData(rawProposal);\n\n  // Add the terms structure for comparison modals\n  const hasHostCounteroffer = base.counterOfferHappened;\n\n  return {\n    ...base,\n    currentTerms: hasHostCounteroffer ? {\n      daysOfWeek: base.hcDaysSelected || base.daysSelected,\n      totalRent: base.hcTotalPrice || base.totalPrice,\n      // ... other term mappings\n    } : {\n      daysOfWeek: base.daysSelected,\n      totalRent: base.totalPrice,\n    },\n    originalTerms: {\n      daysOfWeek: base.daysSelected,\n      totalRent: base.totalPrice,\n    },\n    _listing: listing,\n    _guest: guest,\n    _host: host,\n  };\n}\n\n// STEP 3: Delete processors/proposal/processProposalData.js\n// STEP 4: Update loadProposalDetailsWorkflow.js to use new function\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Identify all imports of `processors/proposal/processProposalData.js`\n- [ ] Update imports to use consolidated version\n- [ ] Test proposal detail loading on guest proposals page\n- [ ] Test counteroffer comparison modal\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 3: Repeated price tier, week pattern, sort option validation pattern\n**Files:** `rules/search/isValidPriceTier.js`, `rules/search/isValidSortOption.js`, `rules/search/isValidWeekPattern.js`\n**Line:** Full files (32 lines each)\n**Issue:** Three nearly identical validation functions with the same structure. Each imports a constant array and checks inclusion. This is boilerplate that could be generalized.\n**Affected Pages:** /search\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n// rules/search/isValidPriceTier.js\nimport { VALID_PRICE_TIERS } from '../../constants/searchConstants.js';\nexport function isValidPriceTier({ priceTier }) {\n  if (typeof priceTier !== 'string') {\n    throw new Error(`isValidPriceTier: priceTier must be a string, got ${typeof priceTier}`)\n  }\n  return VALID_PRICE_TIERS.includes(priceTier)\n}\n\n// rules/search/isValidSortOption.js - identical structure\n// rules/search/isValidWeekPattern.js - identical structure\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// rules/search/searchValidators.js - Consolidated validator factory\nimport { VALID_PRICE_TIERS, VALID_SORT_OPTIONS, VALID_WEEK_PATTERNS } from '../../constants/searchConstants.js';\n\n/**\n * Factory for creating search parameter validators.\n * @param {string} paramName - Parameter name for error messages\n * @param {string[]} validValues - Array of valid values\n * @returns {Function} Validator function\n */\nfunction createSearchValidator(paramName, validValues) {\n  return function({ [paramName]: value }) {\n    if (typeof value !== 'string') {\n      throw new Error(`isValid${paramName.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + paramName.slice(1)}: ${paramName} must be a string, got ${typeof value}`);\n    }\n    return validValues.includes(value);\n  };\n}\n\nexport const isValidPriceTier = createSearchValidator('priceTier', VALID_PRICE_TIERS);\nexport const isValidSortOption = createSearchValidator('sortBy', VALID_SORT_OPTIONS);\nexport const isValidWeekPattern = createSearchValidator('weekPattern', VALID_WEEK_PATTERNS);\n\n// Re-export for backward compatibility (can be deleted after migration)\nexport { VALID_PRICE_TIERS, VALID_SORT_OPTIONS, VALID_WEEK_PATTERNS };\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Update `useSearchPageLogic.js` imports\n- [ ] Delete individual validator files after migration\n- [ ] Test search filter application\n\n~~~~~\n\n## PAGE GROUP: /guest-proposals (Chunks: 4, 5, 6)\n\n### CHUNK 4: Duplicate canCancelProposal implementations\n**Files:** `rules/proposals/canCancelProposal.js`, `rules/proposals/proposalRules.js`\n**Line:** 1-48 (canCancelProposal.js), 26-54 (proposalRules.js)\n**Issue:** `canCancelProposal` is implemented twice with different signatures - one takes `{ proposalStatus, deleted }` object, the other takes a full `proposal` object.
