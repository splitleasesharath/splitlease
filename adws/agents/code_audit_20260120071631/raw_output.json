Identify the specific file and line number\n2. Trace imports/usage to determine which UI pages are affected\n3. Provide exact current code snippet\n4. Provide refactored code solution\n5. List testing steps\n\n## Page Tracing Guidelines\n- Follow import chains to find page components that use this logic\n- Common page paths: /search, /view-split-lease, /listing-dashboard, /proposal, /messages, etc.\n- For shared utilities, identify all entry points\n- If uncertain about page impact, use \"AUTO\"\n\n## Output Requirements\nCreate a markdown file at: .claude/plans/New/20260120071631_code_refactor_plan.md\n\nFormat must follow this structure:\n\n```markdown\n# Code Refactoring Plan - app/src/logic\n\nDate: 2026-01-20\nAudit Type: general\n\n~~~~~\n\n## PAGE GROUP: /page-name (Chunks: X, Y)\n\n### CHUNK 1: [Brief description]\n**File:** [path]\n**Line:** [line]\n**Issue:** [description]\n**Affected Pages:** /page-name\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n[exact code]\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n[refactored code]\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] [step]\n\n~~~~~\n```\n\n## Critical Rules\n1. Group chunks by PAGE GROUP header\n2. One chunk = one atomic fix\n3. Use EXACTLY `~~~~~` as horizontal separator between chunks\n4. Each chunk MUST have TWO complete code blocks (Current vs Refactored)\n5. Line numbers must be accurate\n6. Include affected pages in EACH chunk metadata\n7. Wrap file paths in backticks\n\n## Chunk Format\n```\n## Chunk N of M\n- **Files**: `path/to/file1.js`, `path/to/file2.js`\n- **Rationale**: Why these files are grouped together\n- **Approach**: How to refactor them\n```\n\nStart by exploring all files in app/src/logic to understand the codebase structure, then identify issues and create the refactoring plan.",

They have incompatible APIs and return different data shapes:\n- `processors/proposal/processProposalData.js` (149 lines): Takes `{rawProposal, listing, guest, host}`, returns `{id, currentTerms, originalTerms, hasCounteroffer, ...}`\n- `processors/proposals/processProposalData.js` (305 lines): Takes `rawProposal` only, auto-processes nested `listing`, `host`, `virtualMeeting`, returns `{id, daysSelected, nightsSelected, ...}`\n\n**Affected Pages:** /my-proposals, /proposal, /view-split-lease\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n// File: app/src/logic/processors/proposal/processProposalData.js (NEWER - 149 lines)\nexport function processProposalData({ rawProposal, listing = null, guest = null, host = null }) {\n  if (!rawProposal) {\n    throw new Error('processProposalData: rawProposal cannot be null or undefined')\n  }\n  // ... returns currentTerms/originalTerms shape\n  return {\n    id: rawProposal._id,\n    listingId: rawProposal.Listing,\n    guestId: rawProposal.Guest,\n    status,\n    currentTerms,\n    originalTerms,\n    hasCounteroffer: hasHostCounteroffer,\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\n// File: app/src/logic/processors/proposals/processProposalData.js (OLDER - 305 lines)\nexport function processProposalData(rawProposal) {\n  if (!rawProposal) {\n    throw new Error('processProposalData: Proposal data is required');\n  }\n  // Auto-processes nested listing, host, virtualMeeting\n  const listing = processListingData(rawProposal.listing);\n  const host = processHostData(rawProposal.listing?.host);\n  const virtualMeeting = processVirtualMeetingData(rawProposal.virtualMeeting);\n  // ... returns flat shape with daysSelected, nightsSelected, etc.\n  return {\n    id: rawProposal._id,\n    daysSelected: rawProposal['Days Selected'] || [],\n    nightsSelected: rawProposal['Nights Selected (Nights list)'] || [],\n    listing,\n    host,\n    virtualMeeting,\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// STEP 1: Keep ONLY app/src/logic/processors/proposal/processProposalData.js\n// STEP 2: Delete app/src/logic/processors/proposals/processProposalData.js entirely\n// STEP 3: Move helper functions (processListingData, processHostData, processVirtualMeetingData,\n//         formatPrice, formatDate, formatDateTime, getProposalDisplayText, getEffectiveTerms)\n//         to separate files if needed elsewhere\n\n// The newer implementation in processors/proposal/ is preferred because:\n// 1. It uses named parameters (more explicit)\n// 2. It properly handles counteroffer merging via currentTerms/originalTerms\n// 3. It follows the \"No Fallback\" principle with explicit error messages\n// 4. It doesn't auto-process nested data (allows for lazy loading)\n\n// If helper functions are needed, create:\n// app/src/logic/processors/listing/processListingData.js\n// app/src/logic/processors/user/processHostData.js\n// app/src/logic/processors/virtualMeeting/processVirtualMeetingData.js\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Search for all imports of `from '../../processors/proposals/processProposalData'`\n- [ ] Update imports to use `from '../../processors/proposal/processProposalData'`\n- [ ] Run `bun run build` to verify no import errors\n- [ ] Test /my-proposals page loads correctly\n- [ ] Test /proposal page displays proposal details correctly\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 2: Consolidate duplicate cancelProposalWorkflow workflows\n**File:** `app/src/logic/workflows/booking/cancelProposalWorkflow.js`, `app/src/logic/workflows/proposals/cancelProposalWorkflow.js`\n**Line:** 1-143 (booking), 1-176 (proposals)\n**Issue:** Two completely different cancellation workflow implementations with different business logic:\n- `workflows/booking/cancelProposalWorkflow.js` (143 lines): Complex 7-variation decision tree based on source, usualOrder, and house manual access.
