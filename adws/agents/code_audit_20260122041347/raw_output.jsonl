BUILD_PROCESS\n\n### Development\n[COMMAND]: bun run dev\n[PORT]: 8000\n[SERVER]: Vite dev server with HMR\n[MIDDLEWARE]: Multi-page routing middleware using Route Registry\n[PUBLIC_PREFIX]: /public (proxied to public/ directory)\n[API_PROXY]: /api/* proxied to localhost:8788 (wrangler)\n\n### Production Build\n[COMMAND]: bun run build\n[STEPS]: 1) Prebuild (generate routes), 2) Vite build, 3) Post-build (move HTML, copy assets)\n[OUTPUT]: dist/ directory\n[HTML_LOCATION]: dist root (e.g., dist/index.html)\n[ASSETS_LOCATION]: dist/assets/ with hashed filenames\n[INTERNAL_FILES]: dist/_internal/ (copies of HTML files for Cloudflare routing)\n[COPIED_DIRS]: assets/, images/, help-center-articles/, functions/\n[COPIED_FILES]: _redirects, _headers, _routes.json\n\n### Preview\n[COMMAND]: bun run preview\n[PORT]: 8000\n[SERVER]: Vite preview server (serves dist/)\n[MIDDLEWARE]: Multi-page routing middleware using Route Registry\n[PUBLIC_PREFIX]: Empty string (serves from dist root)\n\n---\n\n## DEPLOYMENT\n\n### Platform\n[TARGET]: Cloudflare Pages\n[BUILD_COMMAND]: bun run build\n[OUTPUT_DIR]: dist\n[NODE_VERSION]: 18 or higher\n[FRAMEWORK_PRESET]: None (custom Vite config)\n\n### Routing Strategy\n[METHOD]: Cloudflare _redirects file + _internal directory\n[WHY_INTERNAL]: Avoid Cloudflare's \"pretty URL\" 308 redirects that strip query params/hash\n[DYNAMIC_ROUTES]: Rewrite to _internal/route-name files\n[STATIC_ROUTES]: Some use _internal/, some direct to .html\n\n### Functions\n[CLOUDFLARE_FUNCTIONS]: /api/* (legacy, deprecated)\n[SUPABASE_EDGE_FUNCTIONS]: Preferred for all backend logic\n[EXCLUDED_ROUTES]: /guest-proposals/*, /host-proposals/* (no Functions processing)\n\n---\n\n## ENTRY_POINTS\n\n### HTML Templates (public/*.html)\n[COUNT]: 27 files\n[PURPOSE]: Shell pages that load React apps\n[PATTERN]: <div id=\"root\"></div> + <script type=\"module\" src=\"/src/ENTRY.jsx\"></script>\n[BUILD_BEHAVIOR]: Vite processes, outputs to dist root with hashed asset references\n\n### React Entry Points (src/*.jsx)\n[COUNT]: 27 files\n[PATTERN]: Import page component, createRoot, render to #root\n[EXAMPLES]: main.jsx → HomePage, search.jsx → SearchPage, view-split-lease.jsx → ViewSplitLeasePage\n\n### Entry Point Mapping\n[HOMEPAGE]: index.html ←

ARCHITECTURE_PATTERNS\n\n### Islands Architecture\n[DESCRIPTION]: Each HTML page is an independent React root\n[BENEFIT]: No shared state between pages, simpler mental model\n[NAVIGATION]: Full page loads (no client-side routing)\n[STATE_PERSISTENCE]: URL params, localStorage, Supabase database\n\n### Route Registry Pattern\n[DESCRIPTION]: Single source of truth for all routes in src/routes.config.js\n[CONSUMERS]: Vite dev server, Vite preview, Cloudflare _redirects, Vite build inputs\n[BENEFIT]: Change route once, updates everywhere\n[VALIDATION]: Automated checks in generate-redirects.js\n\n### Cloudflare _internal Pattern\n[DESCRIPTION]: Copy HTML files to dist/_internal/ with custom names\n[WHY]: Avoid Cloudflare's automatic 308 redirects that strip query params/hash\n[USAGE]: Dynamic routes and pages needing query/hash preservation\n[EXAMPLE]: /search → /_internal/search-view\n\n### Hollow Component Pattern\n[DESCRIPTION]: Page components delegate all logic to custom hooks\n[BENEFIT]: Testable business logic, focused UI components\n[LOCATION]: src/islands/pages/\n[EXAMPLE]: ViewSplitLeasePage.jsx (UI only) + useViewSplitLeasePageLogic.js (logic)\n\n### Four-Layer Logic Architecture\n[DESCRIPTION]: Business logic separated into calculators, rules, processors, workflows\n[LOCATION]: src/logic/\n[LAYER_1]: Calculators (pure math functions: calculate*, get*)\n[LAYER_2]: Rules (boolean predicates: can*, is*, has*, should*)\n[LAYER_3]: Processors (data transformation: adapt*, extract*, process*, format*)\n[LAYER_4]: Workflows (orchestration: *Workflow)\n[BENEFIT]: Reusable, testable, maintainable business logic\n\n---\n\n## ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES\n\n### Frontend (VITE_ prefix)\n[VITE_SUPABASE_URL]: Supabase project URL (from Supabase dashboard)\n[VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY]: Supabase anonymous key (public, safe for client)\n[VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY]: Google Maps JavaScript API key\n\n### Backend (Supabase Secrets)\n[BUBBLE_API_BASE_URL]: Bubble.io API endpoint (legacy backend)\n[BUBBLE_API_KEY]: Bubble.io API authentication\n[OPENAI_API_KEY]: OpenAI API for AI features\n[SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY]: Supabase admin key (server-side only)\n\n### Configuration Location\n[FRONTEND_ENV]: app/.env (local), Cloudflare Pages settings (production)\n[BACKEND_SECRETS]: Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → Edge Functions Secrets\n[SECURITY]: Never expose Bubble/OpenAI keys in frontend code\n\n---\n\n## CRITICAL_CONVENTIONS\n\n### Day Indexing\n[JS_FORMAT]: 0-6 (Sunday=0, Monday=1, ..., Saturday=6)\n[BUBBLE_FORMAT]: 1-7 (Sunday=1, Monday=2, ..., Saturday=7)\n[CONVERSION_FUNCTIONS]: adaptDaysFromBubble(), adaptDaysToBubble()\n[LOCATION]: src/logic/processors/external/\n[RULE]: Always convert at API boundaries, never mix formats\n\n### Unique ID Generation\n[METHOD]: Supabase RPC function generate_bubble_id\n[USAGE]: const { data: newId } = await supabaseAdmin.rpc('generate_bubble_id')\n[FORMAT]: 17-character alphanumeric string (Bubble-compatible)\n\n### API Architecture\n[FRONTEND_TO_BACKEND]: Frontend → Supabase Edge Functions → Bubble API\n[DIRECT_SUPABASE]: Frontend → Supabase Database (for Supabase-native tables)\n[NEVER]: Frontend → Bubble API directly (security violation)\n\n---\n\n## DO_RULES\n\n[DO_USE_ROUTE_REGISTRY]: Always update src/routes.config.js for route changes\n[DO_GENERATE_ROUTES]: Run bun run generate-routes after route config changes\n[DO_USE_EDGE_FUNCTIONS]: Proxy all Bubble API calls through Supabase Edge Functions\n[DO_STORE_SECRETS]: Keep API keys in Supabase Secrets, never in frontend\n[DO_COMMIT_CHANGES]: Git commit after each logical change (per project instructions)\n[DO_USE_ESM]: Use ES modules (import/export), not CommonJS\n[DO_USE_BUN]: Prefer bun for package management and script execution\n[DO_USE_HOLLOW_PATTERN]: Keep page components minimal, delegate logic to hooks\n[DO_USE_FOUR_LAYERS]: Organize business logic into calculators/rules/processors/workflows\n[DO_CONVERT_DAYS]: Use adaptDaysFromBubble/adaptDaysToBubble at API boundaries\n\n---\n\n## DONT_RULES\n\n[DONT_EDIT_GENERATED]: Never manually edit _redirects or _routes.json (auto-generated)\n[DONT_EXPOSE_KEYS]: Never put Bubble/OpenAI API keys in frontend code or .env\n[DONT_SKIP_VALIDATION]: Always run generate-redirects.js validation before deploying\n[DONT_CALL_BUBBLE_DIRECTLY]: Never call Bubble API from frontend (security risk)\n[DONT_MIX_DAY_FORMATS]: Never use 0-based and 1-based days in same function\n[DONT_PUSH_FORCE]: Never git push --force to main/master\n[DONT_ADD_FALLBACKS]: No fallback mechanisms when encountering errors (per project philosophy)\n[DONT_OVER_ENGINEER]: Match solution to actual scale, not hypothetical future needs\n[DONT_MODIFY_DB]: Never modify Supabase tables without explicit instruction\n\n---\n\n##

Indexing Convention\n[INTERNAL]: JavaScript 0-6 (Sunday=0, Monday=1, ..., Saturday=6)\n[BUBBLE_API]: Bubble 1-7 (Sunday=1, Monday=2, ..., Saturday=7)\n[CONVERSION]: ALWAYS use adaptDaysFromBubble/adaptDaysToBubble at boundaries\n[LOCATION]: logic/processors/external/\n\n```javascript\nimport { adaptDaysFromBubble } from 'logic/processors/external/adaptDaysFromBubble.js';\nimport { adaptDaysToBubble } from 'logic/processors/external/adaptDaysToBubble.js';\n\n// Receiving from Bubble API\nconst jsDays = adaptDaysFromBubble({ bubbleDays: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] }); // → [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n// Sending to Bubble API\nconst bubbleDays = adaptDaysToBubble({ jsDays: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] }); // → [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\n### Hollow Component Pattern\n[DESCRIPTION]: UI component delegates ALL logic to custom hook\n[COMPONENT]: Contains only JSX rendering\n[HOOK]: Contains all state, effects, handlers\n[BENEFIT]: Testable logic, focused rendering, reusable logic\n\n```javascript\n// islands/pages/ViewSplitLeasePage.jsx\nexport default function ViewSplitLeasePage() {\n  const logic = useViewSplitLeasePageLogic();\n  return <div>{/* Pure JSX using logic.* */}</div>;\n}\n\n// islands/pages/useViewSplitLeasePageLogic.js\nexport function useViewSplitLeasePageLogic() {\n  // ALL state, effects, handlers here\n  return { /* exported API */ };\n}\n```\n\n### Secure Storage Pattern\n[DESCRIPTION]: Encrypt sensitive data in localStorage\n[USED_FOR]: Auth tokens, session IDs\n[ENCRYPTION]: AES encryption\n\n```javascript\nimport { setSecureItem, getSecureItem, removeSecureItem } from 'lib/secureStorage.js';\n\n// Store encrypted\nsetSecureItem('splitlease_auth_token', token);\n\n// Retrieve and decrypt\nconst token = getSecureItem('splitlease_auth_token');\n\n// Remove\nremoveSecureItem('splitlease_auth_token');\n```\n\n### API Proxy Pattern\n[DESCRIPTION]: All Bubble API calls go through Supabase Edge Functions\n[REASON]: Keep API keys server-side\n[NEVER]: Call Bubble API directly from frontend\n\n```javascript\nimport { bubbleAPI } from 'lib/bubbleAPI.js';\n\n// Proxied through Edge Function\nconst listing = await bubbleAPI.getListing(listingId);\n```\n\n---\n\n## IMPORT_ALIASES\n\n[ALIAS]: logic/* → C:\\Users\\Split Lease\\Documents\\Split Lease\\app\\src\\logic/*\n[ALIAS]: lib/* → C:\\Users\\Split Lease\\Documents\\Split Lease\\app\\src\\lib/*\n[ALIAS]: islands/* → C:\\Users\\Split Lease\\Documents\\Split Lease\\app\\src\\islands/*\n[ALIAS]: styles/* → C:\\Users\\Split Lease\\Documents\\Split Lease\\app\\src\\styles/*\n\n```javascript\n// Use absolute imports from src/\nimport { calculateFourWeekRent } from 'logic/calculators/pricing/calculateFourWeekRent.js';\nimport { checkAuthStatus } from 'lib/auth.js';\nimport Button from 'islands/shared/Button.jsx';\n```\n\n---\n\n## KEY_DATA_FLOWS\n\n### Authentication Flow\n[ENTRY]: User submits login form\n[STEP_1]: lib/auth.js → loginUser()\n[STEP_2]: Supabase Edge Function auth-user\n[STEP_3]: Bubble API validates credentials\n[STEP_4]: Token stored via lib/secureStorage.js\n[STEP_5]: User type stored (Host/Guest)\n[EXIT]: Redirect to dashboard\n\n### Proposal Creation Flow\n[ENTRY]: Guest clicks \"Book\" on listing\n[STEP_1]: islands/shared/CreateProposalFlowV2.jsx modal opens\n[STEP_2]: User selects days (uses day conversion)\n[STEP_3]: logic/calculators/pricing calculates prices\n[STEP_4]: logic/rules/proposals validates proposal\n[STEP_5]: logic/workflows/proposals orchestrates submission\n[STEP_6]: Supabase Edge Function → Bubble API\n[EXIT]: Redirect to guest-proposals page\n\n### Listing Search Flow\n[ENTRY]: User visits /search\n[STEP_1]: islands/pages/SearchPage.jsx renders\n[STEP_2]: User sets filters (days, price, location)\n[STEP_3]: lib/dataLookups.js fetches listings from Supabase\n[STEP_4]: logic/rules/search validates filters\n[STEP_5]: islands/shared/GoogleMap.jsx displays results\n[EXIT]: User clicks listing → /view-split-lease/:id\n\n---\n\n##

Export from layer's index.js\n\n### When Adding API Call\n1. Add function to lib/bubbleAPI.js or lib/supabase.js\n2. Use Edge Function proxy for Bubble API\n3. Add error handling\n4. Use secure storage for tokens\n\n### When Converting Days\n1. Identify system boundary (Bubble API ↔ Internal)\n2. Use adaptDaysFromBubble when receiving from Bubble\n3. Use adaptDaysToBubble when sending to Bubble\n4. NEVER mix 0-based and 1-based in same function\n\n---\n\n## CRITICAL_FILES\n\n### Must Read Before Changes\n[FILE]: routes.config.js - Route definitions\n[FILE]: lib/constants.js - All configuration\n[FILE]: lib/auth.js - Authentication system\n[FILE]: logic/processors/external/adaptDays*.js - Day conversion\n\n### Don't Modify\n[DIR]: routes/ - Auto-generated\n[FILE]: Any file in logic/ without understanding four-layer pattern\n\n---\n\n## METRICS\n\n[ENTRY_POINTS]: 29\n[LOGIC_FILES]: 57\n[LIB_FILES]: 24\n[TOTAL_FILES]: 150+\n[CALCULATORS]: 9\n[RULES]: 22\n[PROCESSORS]: 14\n[WORKFLOWS]: 12\n[CSS_FILES]: 10+ global\n[ROUTES]: 30+\n\n---\n\n**VERSION**: 5.0\n**LAST_UPDATED**: 2025-12-11\n**MAINTAINER**: Claude Code\n","numLines":747,"startLine":1,"totalLines":747}}}

Magic Numbers in Score Calculations\n- `calculateBoroughScore.js` line 62: hardcoded `15` for adjacent borough score\n- `calculatePriceScore.js` lines 78-86: hardcoded `15`, `10`, `5` for threshold scores\n- `calculateHostScore.js` lines 48-51: hardcoded `3`, `1` for verification score mapping\n- `formatMatchResult.js` lines 99-142: hardcoded score thresholds for descriptions\n\n### 2. Duplicated Verification Field Extraction\n- `isVerifiedHost.js` lines 41-45 and 74-77: identical verification field extraction logic duplicated in both `isVerifiedHost()` and `countHostVerifications()`\n\n### 3. Missing Index Exports\n- `extractBorough.js` and its helper functions are not exported from `processors/matching/index.js`\n\n### 4. Unnecessary Parameter Duplication\n- `calculateBoroughScore.js` duplicates borough extraction logic that exists in `extractBorough.js`\n- `calculateMatchHeuristics.js` lines 46-55 duplicates the same borough extraction pattern\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Order\n\n1. `app/src/logic/calculators/matching/constants.js` - Add missing score constants\n2. `app/src/logic/calculators/matching/calculateBoroughScore.js` - Use constants instead of magic number\n3. `app/src/logic/calculators/matching/calculatePriceScore.js` - Use constants for threshold

`countHostVerifications()` now use the shared helper\n- Added JSDoc for the helper function\n\n---\n\n### 6. `app/src/logic/processors/matching/index.js`\n\n**Reason:** Add missing exports for `extractBorough` functions to make them accessible via the module index.\n**Dependents:** 0 (index file)\n**Risk:** LOW\n\n#### Current Code\n```javascript\n/**\n * Matching Processors\n *\n * Data transformation functions for Quick Match algorithm.\n * Adapts raw data to normalized formats and formats results for display.\n *\n * @module logic/processors/matching\n */\n\n// Data adapters\nexport { adaptCandidateListing } from './adaptCandidateListing.js';\nexport { adaptProposalForMatching } from './adaptProposalForMatching.js';\n\n// Result formatters\nexport {

extractProposalBorough\n} from './extractBorough.js';\n\n// Result formatters\nexport { formatMatchResult, getTier } from './formatMatchResult.js';\n```\n\n#### Changes Made\n- Added exports for `extractBorough`, `extractCandidateBorough`, and `extractProposalBorough` from `extractBorough.js`\n- Organized exports with a section comment for borough extraction utilities\n\n---\n\n## Edge Cases & Error Handling\n\n- All changes maintain existing error handling patterns (NO FALLBACK philosophy)\n- Constants are used by existing validation logic unchanged\n- No changes to function signatures or return types\n\n## Testing Considerations\n\n- Verify `calculateBoroughScore` returns `ADJACENT_BOROUGH_SCORE` (15) for adjacent boroughs\n- Verify `calculatePriceScore` returns correct threshold scores (15, 10, 5)\n- Verify `calculateHostScore` returns correct verification scores (5, 3, 1, 0)\n- Verify `countHostVerifications` and `isVerifiedHost` produce identical results as before\n- Verify `extractBorough` functions are accessible via index import\n\n## Rollback Strategy\n\n- Each file change is independent and can be reverted individually\n- Constants are additive (no removals) so existing code remains compatible\n- If issues arise, revert to hardcoded values in calculator files\n\n## Dependencies & Blockers\n\n- None - all changes are within the logic layer with no external dependencies\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\n| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |\n|------|------------|--------|------------|\n| Constant value mismatch | Low | Medium | Values are directly copied from existing hardcoded values |\n| Import path errors | Low | Low | All imports use existing patterns |\n| Behavioral regression | Very Low | Medium | No logic changes, only value extraction to
