SHARED COMPONENTS & UTILITIES\n\n**Major Shared Components (app/src/islands/shared/):**\n1. **CreateProposalFlowV2.jsx** - Multi-step booking wizard (150+ lines, complex state)\n2. **ListingScheduleSelector.jsx** - Day selection UI with pricing display\n3. **GoogleMap.jsx** - Google Maps integration for listing markers\n4. **Header.jsx** - Site navigation with auth state awareness\n5. **Footer.jsx** - Site-wide footer\n6. **ListingCard.jsx** - Reusable listing display card\n7. **Toast.jsx** - Notification system\n8. **SearchScheduleSelector.jsx** - Schedule picker for search filters\n9. **ContactHostMessaging.jsx** - Message interface\n10. **VirtualMeetingManager/** - Complex meeting scheduling module\n\n**Feature Modules (92 files in shared/):**\n- **VirtualMeetingManager/**: Meeting scheduling, slot proposals, cancellation\n- **LoggedInAvatar/**: User dropdown menu with account options\n- **HostScheduleSelector/**: Day selection for host listing management\n- **CreateProposalFlowV2Components/**: Sub-components for proposal wizard\n- **SubmitListingPhotos/**: Photo upload and management\n- **AIImportAssistantModal/**: AI content generation for listings\n- **ImportListingModal/**: Bulk listing import workflow\n- **CreateDuplicateListingModal/**: Listing duplication feature\n\n**Library Utilities (app/src/lib/):**\n- **auth.js** - Authentication & token management with secure storage\n- **supabase.js** - Supabase client initialization\n- **bubbleAPI.js** - Bubble API proxy (all calls through Edge Functions)\n- **dataLookups.js** - Fetch reference data (amenities, neighborhoods, boroughs)\n- **listingService.js** - Listing CRUD operations\n- **secureStorage.js** - AES-encrypted localStorage wrapper\n- **constants.js** - All application constants\n- **dayUtils.js** - Day formatting and parsing utilities\n- **urlParams.js** - URL parameter helpers\n- **priceCalculations.js** - Legacy pricing (being migrated to logic/calculators/)\n- **sanitize.js** - Input sanitization\n- **photoUpload.js** - Photo upload to Supabase storage\n- **slackService.js** - Slack notifications\n- **aiService.js** - AI service integration\n- **logger.js** - Logging utility\n- **mapUtils.js** - Google Maps helpers\n\n---\n\n### 5. PERFORMANCE ISSUES IDENTIFIED\n\n**Critical Concerns:**\n\n1. **Large Component Files:**\n   - SearchPage.jsx: **2,976 lines** - exceeds maintainability threshold\n   - ViewSplitLeasePage.jsx: **2,953 lines** - massive single component\n   - These are monolithic and likely contain multiple responsibilities\n   - **Impact**: Hard to test, understand, modify\n\n2. **Missing Memoization:**\n   - CreateProposalFlowV2.jsx - 150+ lines of inline logic without useMemo\n   - ListingScheduleSelector.jsx - Day grid mapping without React.memo on DayButton children\n   - **Impact**: Unnecessary re-renders on parent state changes\n\n3. **Hook Count Issues:**\n   - useListingDashboardPageLogic composes 4 sub-hooks\n   - Some pages use 6+ useState calls in single hook\n   - **Impact**: Complex state management, hard to follow data flow\n\n4. **Lack of Optimization Patterns:**\n   - No React.memo usage on expensive shared components\n   - No useCallback optimization on event handlers\n   - ListingCard likely re-renders on every parent update\n   - **Impact**: Search results page with 20+ cards will have poor performance\n\n5. **SearchPage Specific Issues:**\n   - Maps two-column layout with filter panel + listings grid\n   - Google Maps integration without viewport/marker clustering\n   - 51 useState/useEffect calls in logic hook\n   - Multiple filter states triggering cascading updates\n   - **Impact**: Sluggish filter interactions, map redraws on every filter change\n\n6. **State Management Complexity:**\n   - Hollow Component Pattern doesn't prevent state explosion in hooks\n   - useListingDashboardPageLogic orchestrates 4 sub-hooks, returns 20+ values\n   - No centralized state management (Redux, Zustand) for complex pages\n   - **Impact**: Prop drilling, complex refactoring required for changes\n\n---\n\n### 6. MAINTAINABILITY ISSUES\n\n**Code Organization Problems:**\n\n1. **Monolithic Page Components:**\n   - ViewSplitLeasePage.jsx (2,953 lines) - should be split into sections\n   - PreviewSplitLeasePage.jsx (1,928 lines) - duplicates ViewSplitLeasePage logic\n   - SearchPage.jsx (2,976 lines) - FilterPanel, ListingsGrid, Map could be separate modules\n   - **Recommendation**: Extract into feature modules (max 400-500 lines per file)\n\n2. **Duplicated Logic:**\n   - Day selection logic appears in: ListingScheduleSelector, SearchScheduleSelector, HostScheduleSelector\n   - Pricing calculations in both logic/calculators and lib/scheduleSelector/priceCalculations\n   - Price display logic repeated across multiple components\n   - **Recommendation**: Consolidate into shared utilities\n\n3. **Incomplete Logic Layer Migration:**\n   - lib/scheduleSelector/priceCalculations.js still exists\n   - TODO comment: \"Migrate pricing to Logic Core\"\n   - Mixed pattern: some components use logic/calculators, others use lib/scheduleSelector\n   - **Recommendation**: Complete migration, remove lib/scheduleSelector\n\n4. **TODO/FIXME Debt (16 items found):**\n   - CompareTermsModal.jsx: \"Implement proper backend API workflow scheduling\"\n   - PhotosSection.jsx: \"Handle photo type change\"\n   - useScheduleSelectorLogicCore.js: \"Migrate pricing to Logic Core\"\n   - HostProposalsPage: \"Implement proper reminder system\"\n   - MessagingPage: \"Implement unread count\"\n   - **Impact**: Technical debt accumulation, incomplete features\n\n5. **Inconsistent Patterns:**\n   - Some pages have separate logic hooks, others have inline state\n   - Some use Zustand (SelfListingPage), most use useState\n   - Some modals are full-screen overlays, others use modal library\n   - **Recommendation**: Standardize on one pattern per feature type\n\n---\n\n### 7. CODE DUPLICATION\n\n**Identified Duplications:**\n\n1. **Schedule Selection Components** (3 variants):\n   - ListingScheduleSelector.jsx\n   - SearchScheduleSelector.jsx\n   - AuthAwareSearchScheduleSelector.jsx (wrapper)\n   - **Duplication**: Day grid rendering, price calculations, selection logic\n   - **Lines of code**: ~300 lines duplicated across 3 files\n\n2. **Proposal Detail Display** (2 variants):\n   - ProposalCard.jsx (1,452 lines)\n   - ProposalDetailsModal.jsx (707 lines in HostProposalsPage)\n   - **Duplication**: Status display, timeline, term formatting\n\n3. **Pricing Calculation** (3 places):\n   - logic/calculators/pricing/\n   - lib/scheduleSelector/priceCalculations.js\n   - Inline in CreateProposalFlowV2.jsx\n   - **Impact**: Sync issues when logic changes\n\n4. **User Avatar/Profile** (2 implementations):\n   - LoggedInAvatar component\n   - Avatar embedded in Header\n   - **Duplication**: Profile photo handling, dropdown logic\n\n---\n\n### 8. ANTI-PATTERNS DETECTED\n\n**React Anti-Patterns:**\n\n1. **Inline Function Definitions in Render:**\n   ```jsx\n   // In CreateProposalFlowV2.jsx, SearchPage.jsx\n   {items.map((item) => <Component key={item.id} onClick={() => handleClick(item.id)} />)}\n   // Should be: useCallback(handleClick, []) + <Component onClick={() => handleClick(item.id)} />\n   ```\n\n2. **useState in Loops:**\n   - Not explicitly found, but complex ListingDashboardPage might have this risk\n\n3. **Missing Key Props:**\n   - DayButton in grids - check if unique day keys are used\n   - ListingCard in search results - should have listing._id as key\n\n4. **Side Effects in Render:**\n   - useBodyScrollLock in CreateProposalFlowV2 - good practice, but useEffect not properly wrapped\n\n5. **Unnecessary Dependencies:**\n   - useCallback dependencies might be incomplete (found in formatters, handlers)\n\n---\n\n### 9. ROUTES CONFIGURATION\n\n**Route System:**\n- **Single Source of Truth**: routes.config.js (30 routes)\n- **Dynamic Routes**: /view-split-lease/:id, /account-profile/:userId, /help-center/:category\n- **Protected Routes**: 12+ routes require authentication\n- **Cloudflare Routing**: _internal/ pattern to avoid 308 redirects\n- **Generation**: Pre-build script generates _redirects and _routes.json\n\n**Route Types:**\n- Public pages: Home, Search, FAQ, Help Center, About, Careers, Policies\n- Protected pages: ListingDashboard, HostProposals, GuestProposals, AccountProfile\n- Dynamic pages: ViewSplitLease, PreviewSplitLease, HelpCenterCategory\n- Dev-only: index-dev, _internal-test, referral-demo\n\n---\n\n### 10. DEPENDENCIES & STACK\n\n**React 18 + Vite 5 Stack:**\n- React 18.2.0 (Islands Architecture pattern)\n- Vite 5.0 (multi-page build, ESM modules)\n- Supabase (@supabase/supabase-js 2.38.0)\n- Google Maps (@react-google-maps/api 2.20.7)\n- Form handling: react-hook-form 7.66.1 + zod 4.1.12 (validation)\n- Animation: framer-motion 12.23.24 + GSAP 3.14.2\n- Styling: styled-components 6.1.19 + Tailwind CSS 3\n- Icons: lucide-react 0.553.0\n- Date handling: date-fns 4.1.0 + date-fns-tz 3.2.0\n\n**Build Tools:**\n- Vite with React plugin\n- ESLint with react/react-hooks rules\n- TypeScript (5.9.3) - used in some components (SelfListingPage)\n- Supabase CLI for migrations\n\n---\n\n### 11. CRITICAL FILES FOR UNDERSTANDING\n\n**Must Read:**\n1. `app/src/routes.config.js` - Route definitions\n2. `app/src/logic/processors/external/adaptDays*.js` - Day conversion (CRITICAL)\n3. `app/src/lib/constants.js` - All configuration\n4. `app/src/lib/auth.js` - Authentication system\n5. `app/src/islands/shared/CreateProposalFlowV2.jsx` - Booking workflow\n6. `app/vite.config.js` - Build configuration\n7. `app/CLAUDE.md` - Project architecture guide\n\n**Performance Hotspots:**\n1. SearchPage.jsx - 2,976 lines, 51 hook calls\n2. ViewSplitLeasePage.jsx - 2,953 lines, complex pricing calculations\n3. ListingDashboardPage/ - 22 files, complex state orchestration\n4. CreateProposalFlowV2.jsx - Multi-step wizard with localStorage\n\n---\n\n### 12. SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n**Priority 1 - Performance:**\n1. Break SearchPage.jsx into modules: FilterPanel, ListingsGrid, MapSection\n2. Add React.memo to ListingCard and expensive shared components\n3. Implement useCallback for all event handlers in large hooks\n4. Add useMemo for expensive computations (price breakdowns, filtered listings)\n5. Implement virtual scrolling for listings grid (20+ cards)\n\n**Priority 2 - Code Quality:**\n1. Migrate lib/scheduleSelector/priceCalculations.js to logic/calculators/\n2. Consolidate schedule selector components (1 component, 3 variants)\n3. Split ViewSplitLeasePage.jsx into sections (sections/PhotoGallery, sections/PricingSection, etc.)\n4. Resolve all 16 TODO/FIXME comments\n5. Add unit tests for logic/ layer functions\n\n**Priority 3 - Maintainability:**\n1. Document Hollow Component Pattern usage (when to use, when not to)\n2. Create reusable modal library for consistency\n3. Standardize on one state management approach (useState vs Zustand)\n4. Add TypeScript to all components (currently only SelfListingPage uses TS)\n5. Create component composition guidelines\n\n---\n\n### 13. MISSING PATTERNS\n\n**What's Not Implemented:**\n- No component library (shadcn, Material-UI, or custom storybook)\n- No centralized state management (Redux, Zupabase, Context for complex state)\n- No error boundary components visible\n- No suspense/code splitting on routes\n- No performance monitoring (Web Vitals)\n- No unit tests in repo (only integration/e2e capability)\n- No accessibility testing (a11y)\n\n---\n\n### SUMMARY TABLE\n\n| Metric | Value | Status |\n|--------|-------|--------|\n| Total Source Files | 484 | ✓ Well-organized |\n| Page Components | 30 | ✓ Comprehensive |\n| Largest Component | 2,976 lines | ⚠️ Needs breaking down |\n| Shared Components | 92 files | ⚠️ Some duplication |\n| Logic Files | 57 files | ✓ Well-structured |\n| React Hooks in Pages | 501+ | ⚠️ Complex state |\n| TODO Comments | 16 | ⚠️ Technical debt |\n| Duplicated Code | ~300 lines | ⚠️ Refactor needed |\n| Memoization Usage | <10% | ⚠️ Performance risk |\n| Protected Routes | 12+ | ✓ Secure |\n| Mobile Responsive | Yes | ✓ |\n| TypeScript Coverage | ~5% | ⚠️ Limited |\n\n---\n\n**This is a mature, feature-rich application with good architectural foundations (Islands Architecture, Hollow Component Pattern, Four-Layer Logic).

DEPENDENCIES & STACK\n\n**React 18 + Vite 5 Stack:**\n- React 18.2.0 (Islands Architecture pattern)\n- Vite 5.0 (multi-page build, ESM modules)\n- Supabase (@supabase/supabase-js 2.38.0)\n- Google Maps (@react-google-maps/api 2.20.7)\n- Form handling: react-hook-form 7.66.1 + zod 4.1.12 (validation)\n- Animation: framer-motion 12.23.24 + GSAP 3.14.2\n- Styling: styled-components 6.1.19 + Tailwind CSS 3\n- Icons: lucide-react 0.553.0\n- Date handling: date-fns 4.1.0 + date-fns-tz 3.2.0\n\n**Build Tools:**\n- Vite with React plugin\n- ESLint with react/react-hooks rules\n- TypeScript (5.9.3) - used in some components (SelfListingPage)\n- Supabase CLI for migrations\n\n---\n\n### 11. CRITICAL FILES FOR UNDERSTANDING\n\n**Must Read:**\n1. `app/src/routes.config.js` - Route definitions\n2. `app/src/logic/processors/external/adaptDays*.js` - Day conversion (CRITICAL)\n3. `app/src/lib/constants.js` - All configuration\n4. `app/src/lib/auth.js` - Authentication system\n5. `app/src/islands/shared/CreateProposalFlowV2.jsx` - Booking workflow\n6. `app/vite.config.js` - Build configuration\n7. `app/CLAUDE.md` - Project architecture guide\n\n**Performance Hotspots:**\n1. SearchPage.jsx - 2,976 lines, 51 hook calls\n2. ViewSplitLeasePage.jsx - 2,953 lines, complex pricing calculations\n3. ListingDashboardPage/ - 22 files, complex state orchestration\n4. CreateProposalFlowV2.jsx - Multi-step wizard with localStorage\n\n---\n\n### 12. SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n**Priority 1 - Performance:**\n1. Break SearchPage.jsx into modules: FilterPanel, ListingsGrid, MapSection\n2. Add React.memo to ListingCard and expensive shared components\n3. Implement useCallback for all event handlers in large hooks\n4. Add useMemo for expensive computations (price breakdowns, filtered listings)\n5. Implement virtual scrolling for listings grid (20+ cards)\n\n**Priority 2 - Code Quality:**\n1. Migrate lib/scheduleSelector/priceCalculations.js to logic/calculators/\n2. Consolidate schedule selector components (1 component, 3 variants)\n3. Split ViewSplitLeasePage.jsx into sections (sections/PhotoGallery, sections/PricingSection, etc.)\n4. Resolve all 16 TODO/FIXME comments\n5. Add unit tests for logic/ layer functions\n\n**Priority 3 - Maintainability:**\n1. Document Hollow Component Pattern usage (when to use, when not to)\n2. Create reusable modal library for consistency\n3. Standardize on one state management approach (useState vs Zustand)\n4. Add TypeScript to all components (currently only SelfListingPage uses TS)\n5. Create component composition guidelines\n\n---\n\n### 13. MISSING PATTERNS\n\n**What's Not Implemented:**\n- No component library (shadcn, Material-UI, or custom storybook)\n- No centralized state management (Redux, Zupabase, Context for complex state)\n- No error boundary components visible\n- No suspense/code splitting on routes\n- No performance monitoring (Web Vitals)\n- No unit tests in repo (only integration/e2e capability)\n- No accessibility testing (a11y)\n\n---\n\n### SUMMARY TABLE\n\n| Metric | Value | Status |\n|--------|-------|--------|\n| Total Source Files | 484 | ✓ Well-organized |\n| Page Components | 30 | ✓ Comprehensive |\n| Largest Component | 2,976 lines | ⚠️ Needs breaking down |\n| Shared Components | 92 files | ⚠️ Some duplication |\n| Logic Files | 57 files | ✓ Well-structured |\n| React Hooks in Pages | 501+ | ⚠️ Complex state |\n| TODO Comments | 16 | ⚠️ Technical debt |\n| Duplicated Code | ~300 lines | ⚠️ Refactor needed |\n| Memoization Usage | <10% | ⚠️ Performance risk |\n| Protected Routes | 12+ | ✓ Secure |\n| Mobile Responsive | Yes | ✓ |\n| TypeScript Coverage | ~5% | ⚠️ Limited |\n\n---\n\n**This is a mature, feature-rich application with good architectural foundations (Islands Architecture, Hollow Component Pattern, Four-Layer Logic).
