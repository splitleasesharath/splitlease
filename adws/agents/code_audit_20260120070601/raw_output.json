directory strictly follows the declared pattern:\n- **Calculators**: Pure math functions (prefixed `calculate*`, `get*`)\n- **Rules**: Boolean predicates (prefixed `is*`, `can*`, `should*`)\n- **Processors**: Data transformations (prefixed `adapt*`, `format*`, `process*`)\n- **Workflows**: Orchestration (suffixed `*Workflow`)\n\n#### 2. **Domain-Based Organization**\nFiles are grouped by business domain rather than technical function:\n- **auth**: Authentication/session management\n- **pricing**: Nightly rates, reservations, breakdowns\n- **proposals**: Booking proposals, negotiations\n- **scheduling**: Check-in/out, availability, dates\n- **reminders**: Notification timing and delivery\n- **reviews**: Guest/host feedback\n- **users**: Profile and identity data\n- **search**: Listing discovery filters\n- **listing**: Property data handling\n- **booking**: Proposal acceptance/cancellation\n\n#### 3. **Naming Conventions**\n- Functions follow consistent verb-first patterns: `calculate*`, `get*`, `is*`, `can*`, `process*`, `format*`\n- Each file typically exports a single function matching its filename\n- Descriptive names clearly indicate purpose (e.g., `calculateNightsFromDays.js`, `isValidSortOption.js`)\n\n#### 4. **One Empty Directory**\n- `processors/external/` exists as an empty placeholder, suggesting future expansion for external API data processing\n\n#### 5. **Minor Duplication**\n- `processors/proposal/` and `processors/proposals/` both exist (both contain `processProposalData.js`)\n- `workflows/booking/` and `workflows/proposals/` appear to handle related concerns\n\n#### 6. **File Sizing**\n- Consistent unit-of-work approach with individual files per function\n- Supports independent testing and isolated changes\n\n---\n\n### Key Insights\n\n1. **Pure Functional Structure**: The codebase maintains strict separation of concerns with clear input/output patterns\n2. **Dependency-Friendly**: Small, focused files make dependency analysis and refactoring straightforward\n3. **Testability**: Each function can be unit tested independently\n4. **Domain Clarity**: Business logic is immediately identifiable by directory structure\n5. **Scalability**: Adding new features follows a clear pattern: create subdirectory + implement functions in appropriate layers"

directory strictly follows the declared pattern:\n- **Calculators**: Pure math functions (prefixed `calculate*`, `get*`)\n- **Rules**: Boolean predicates (prefixed `is*`, `can*`, `should*`)\n- **Processors**: Data transformations (prefixed `adapt*`, `format*`, `process*`)\n- **Workflows**: Orchestration (suffixed `*Workflow`)\n\n#### 2. **Domain-Based Organization**\nFiles are grouped by business domain rather than technical function:\n- **auth**: Authentication/session management\n- **pricing**: Nightly rates, reservations, breakdowns\n- **proposals**: Booking proposals, negotiations\n- **scheduling**: Check-in/out, availability, dates\n- **reminders**: Notification timing and delivery\n- **reviews**: Guest/host feedback\n- **users**: Profile and identity data\n- **search**: Listing discovery filters\n- **listing**: Property data handling\n- **booking**: Proposal acceptance/cancellation\n\n#### 3. **Naming Conventions**\n- Functions follow consistent verb-first patterns: `calculate*`, `get*`, `is*`, `can*`, `process*`, `format*`\n- Each file typically exports a single function matching its filename\n- Descriptive names clearly indicate purpose (e.g., `calculateNightsFromDays.js`, `isValidSortOption.js`)\n\n#### 4. **One Empty Directory**\n- `processors/external/` exists as an empty placeholder, suggesting future expansion for external API data processing\n\n#### 5. **Minor Duplication**\n- `processors/proposal/` and `processors/proposals/` both exist (both contain `processProposalData.js`)\n- `workflows/booking/` and `workflows/proposals/` appear to handle related concerns\n\n#### 6. **File Sizing**\n- Consistent unit-of-work approach with individual files per function\n- Supports independent testing and isolated changes\n\n---\n\n### Key Insights\n\n1. **Pure Functional Structure**: The codebase maintains strict separation of concerns with clear input/output patterns\n2. **Dependency-Friendly**: Small, focused files make dependency analysis and refactoring straightforward\n3. **Testability**: Each function can be unit tested independently\n4. **Domain Clarity**: Business logic is immediately identifiable by directory structure\n5. **Scalability**: Adding new features follows a clear pattern: create subdirectory + implement functions in appropriate layers"

The primary issues found are:\n\n1. **Critical Duplicate Files** - Two pairs of files with identical names doing the same thing but with different implementations\n2. **Duplicate Logic Functions** - Three functions implementing the same contiguous check logic\n3. **Similar Check-In/Out Calculations** - Two functions with overlapping responsibility and different return signatures\n4. **Duplicate Proposal Rules** - Same `canCancelProposal` function exists in two locations with different signatures\n5. **Broken Import Path** - proposalButtonRules.js imports from non-existent config file\n\n## Dependency Impact Analysis\n\nFiles: 68 | Total Issues: 12 chunks\n\n### CRITICAL IMPACT (30+ dependents) - Avoid modifying\n| File | Dependents |\n|------|------------|\n| `constants/proposalStatuses.js` | ~20+ (used across rules, workflows, processors) |\n| `rules/users/isHost.js` | 4 direct imports |\n| `rules/users/isGuest.js` | 3 direct imports |\n| `processors/display/formatHostName.js` | 6 direct imports |\n\n### LEAF FILES (safe to refactor)\n- `processors/proposal/processProposalData.js` (duplicate - can be removed)\n- `workflows/booking/cancelProposalWorkflow.js` (duplicate - can be consolidated)\n- `calculators/scheduling/isContiguousSelection.js` (duplicate of rules)\n- `calculators/scheduling/calculateCheckInOutFromDays.js` (similar to calculateCheckInOutDays)\n\n~~~~~\n\n## PAGE GROUP: /search (Chunks: 1, 2)\n\n### CHUNK 1: Remove duplicate isContiguousSelection.js\n**File:** `app/src/logic/calculators/scheduling/isContiguousSelection.js`\n**Line:** 1-31\n**Issue:** This file duplicates the logic in `rules/scheduling/isScheduleContiguous.js`. The rules version is more robust with better validation and clearer documentation.\n**Affected Pages:** /search, /view-split-lease (via useScheduleSelectorLogicCore.js)\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n/**\n * Check if selected days form a contiguous block.\n * Handles week wrap-around cases (e.g., Fri-Mon).\n *\n * @.claude\\plans\\Deprecated\\Context\\Option Sets\\ZEP - Curation Parameters(OS).md {number[]} selectedDays - Array of day indices (0-6).\n * @returns {boolean} True if days are contiguous.\n */\nexport function isContiguousSelection(selectedDays) {\n  if (!selectedDays || selectedDays.length === 0) return false;\n  if (selectedDays.length === 1) return true;\n  if (selectedDays.length >= 6) return true;\n\n  const sorted = [...selectedDays].sort((a, b) => a - b);\n  const isStandardContiguous = sorted.every((day, i) => i === 0 || day === sorted[i - 1] + 1);\n  if (isStandardContiguous) return true;\n\n  // Wrap-around check\n  const hasZero = sorted.includes(0);\n  const hasSix = sorted.includes(6);\n  if (hasZero && hasSix) {\n    const allDays = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];\n    const notSelectedDays = allDays.filter(d => !sorted.includes(d));\n\n    const minNotSelected = Math.min(...notSelectedDays);\n    const maxNotSelected = Math.max(...notSelectedDays);\n\n    return notSelectedDays.length === (maxNotSelected - minNotSelected + 1);\n  }\n\n  return false;\n}\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// FILE SHOULD BE DELETED\n// Re-export from the canonical location for backward compatibility\nexport { isScheduleContiguous as isContiguousSelection } from '../../rules/scheduling/isScheduleContiguous.js';\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Verify useScheduleSelectorLogicCore.js still works after update\n- [ ] Run SearchPage to ensure schedule selection works\n- [ ] Test wrap-around day selection (Fri-Mon)\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 2: Consolidate calculateCheckInOutFromDays.js with calculateCheckInOutDays.js\n**File:** `app/src/logic/calculators/scheduling/calculateCheckInOutFromDays.js`\n**Line:** 1-41\n**Issue:** Two files do nearly identical work. `calculateCheckInOutFromDays` returns `{checkIn, checkOut}` while `calculateCheckInOutDays` returns `{checkInDay, checkOutDay, checkInName, checkOutName}`. The latter is more complete. Consumers need to be updated to use a unified API.\n**Affected Pages:** /search (SearchPage.jsx, CompactScheduleIndicator.jsx)\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n/**\n * Calculate check-in and check-out days from selected day indices\n * Handles wrap-around scenarios (e.g., Fri-Mon selection)\n *\n * @param {number[]} selectedDays - Array of day indices (0=Sun, 6=Sat)\n * @returns {{ checkIn: number, checkOut: number } | null}\n */\nexport function calculateCheckInOutFromDays(selectedDays) {\n  if (!selectedDays || selectedDays.length < 2) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  const sortedDays = [...selectedDays].sort((a, b) => a - b);\n  const hasSaturday = sortedDays.includes(6);\n  const hasSunday = sortedDays.includes(0);\n  const isWrapAround = hasSaturday && hasSunday && sortedDays.length < 7;\n\n  if (isWrapAround) {\n    // Find the gap to determine actual boundaries\n    let gapIndex = -1;\n    for (let i = 1; i < sortedDays.length; i++) {\n      if (sortedDays[i] - sortedDays[i - 1] > 1) {\n        gapIndex = i;\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n\n    if (gapIndex !== -1) {\n      return {\n        checkIn: sortedDays[gapIndex],\n        checkOut: sortedDays[gapIndex - 1]\n      };\n    }\n  }\n\n  return {\n    checkIn: sortedDays[0],\n    checkOut: sortedDays[sortedDays.length - 1]\n  };\n}\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\nimport { calculateCheckInOutDays } from './calculateCheckInOutDays.js';\n\n/**\n * Calculate check-in and check-out days from selected day indices.\n *\n * @deprecated Use calculateCheckInOutDays instead for full details including day names.\n * This wrapper exists for backward compatibility with components expecting simplified output.\n *\n * @param {number[]} selectedDays - Array of day indices (0=Sun, 6=Sat)\n * @returns {{ checkIn: number, checkOut: number } | null}\n */\nexport function calculateCheckInOutFromDays(selectedDays) {\n  if (!selectedDays || selectedDays.length < 2) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  try {\n    const result = calculateCheckInOutDays({ selectedDays });\n    return {\n      checkIn: result.checkInDay,\n      checkOut: result.checkOutDay\n    };\n  } catch {\n    return null;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Verify SearchPage.jsx still works\n- [ ] Verify CompactScheduleIndicator.jsx still works\n- [ ] Test wrap-around selection (Fri-Mon)\n\n~~~~~\n\n## PAGE GROUP: /proposals, /view-split-lease (Chunks: 3, 4, 5, 6)\n\n### CHUNK 3: Remove duplicate processors/proposal/processProposalData.js\n**File:** `app/src/logic/processors/proposal/processProposalData.js`\n**Line:** 1-148\n**Issue:** This file exists BOTH at `processors/proposal/processProposalData.js` AND `processors/proposals/processProposalData.js`. The plural version (`proposals/`) has more functions (formatPrice, formatDate, getEffectiveTerms). The singular version has different field mapping. This creates confusion about which to import.\n**Affected Pages:** /proposals, /view-split-lease (via loadProposalDetailsWorkflow.js)\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n// processors/proposal/processProposalData.js (singular)\nimport { PROPOSAL_STATUSES, getUsualOrder } from '../../constants/proposalStatuses.js'\n\nexport function processProposalData({ rawProposal, listing = null, guest = null, host = null }) {\n  // ... 148 lines of proposal processing\n  // Uses different field names: 'Move-In Date', 'Days of Week', etc.\n  // Returns: id, listingId, guestId, status, deleted, usualOrder, currentTerms, originalTerms, hasCounteroffer, ...\n}\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// FILE SHOULD BE DELETED\n// The canonical location is processors/proposals/processProposalData.js (plural)\n// Re-export for backward compatibility\nexport { processProposalData } from '../proposals/processProposalData.js';\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Verify all imports still resolve\n- [ ] Run loadProposalDetailsWorkflow to ensure data loads correctly\n- [ ] Test proposal display on /proposals page\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 4: Remove duplicate workflows/booking/cancelProposalWorkflow.js\n**File:** `app/src/logic/workflows/booking/cancelProposalWorkflow.js`\n**Line:** 1-143\n**Issue:** This file exists BOTH at `workflows/booking/cancelProposalWorkflow.js` AND `workflows/proposals/cancelProposalWorkflow.js`. The `proposals/` version is imported by actual components (ProposalCard.jsx, ExpandableProposalCard.jsx, GuestEditingProposalModal.jsx). The `booking/` version appears unused but has different implementation.\n**Affected Pages:** /proposals (indirectly - currently unused)\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n// workflows/booking/cancelProposalWorkflow.js\nimport { PROPOSAL_STATUSES } from '../../constants/proposalStatuses.js'\n\nexport async function cancelProposalWorkflow({\n  supabase,\n  proposal,\n  source = 'main',\n  canCancelProposal\n}) {\n  // Different signature: takes supabase client and canCancelProposal function as params\n  // Implements 7-variation decision tree\n}\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// FILE SHOULD BE DELETED\n// The canonical location is workflows/proposals/cancelProposalWorkflow.js\n// Re-export for backward compatibility\nexport {\n  executeCancelProposal as cancelProposalWorkflow,\n  determineCancellationCondition,\n  cancelProposalFromCompareTerms,\n  executeDeleteProposal\n} from '../proposals/cancelProposalWorkflow.js';\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Search codebase for imports of workflows/booking/cancelProposalWorkflow\n- [ ] If no direct imports found, file can be safely deleted\n- [ ] Run cancel flow on proposal to verify it still works\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 5: Consolidate duplicate canCancelProposal implementations\n**File:** `app/src/logic/rules/proposals/canCancelProposal.js`\n**Line:** 1-47\n**Issue:** `canCancelProposal` is defined BOTH in `rules/proposals/canCancelProposal.js` (standalone file) AND inside `rules/proposals/proposalRules.js` (line 26-54). They have different signatures and slightly different logic.\n**Affected Pages:** /proposals, /view-split-lease\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n// rules/proposals/canCancelProposal.js (standalone)\nimport { isTerminalStatus, isCompletedStatus } from '../../constants/proposalStatuses.js'\n\nexport function canCancelProposal({ proposalStatus, deleted = false }) {\n  // Takes object with proposalStatus and deleted\n  // Returns boolean\n  if (deleted) return false;\n  if (!proposalStatus || typeof proposalStatus !== 'string') return false;\n  const status = proposalStatus.trim();\n  if (isTerminalStatus(status) || isCompletedStatus(status)) return false;\n  return true;\n}\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// FILE SHOULD BE DELETED\n// Re-export from proposalRules.js for backward compatibility\n// Note: proposalRules.canCancelProposal takes {proposal} not {proposalStatus, deleted}\n// We need to create a wrapper\n\nimport { canCancelProposal as canCancelProposalFromRules } from './proposalRules.js';\n\n/**\n * Wrapper for backward compatibility with code expecting the old signature.\n * @deprecated Import canCancelProposal from proposalRules.js and pass full proposal object.\n */\nexport function canCancelProposal({ proposalStatus, deleted = false }) {\n  // Create minimal proposal object for the rules function\n  return canCancelProposalFromRules({\n    status: proposalStatus,\n    Status: proposalStatus,\n    deleted\n  });\n}\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Find all imports of rules/proposals/canCancelProposal.js\n- [ ] Verify each consumer still works with the wrapper\n- [ ] Consider migrating consumers to use proposalRules.js directly\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 6: Fix broken import in proposalButtonRules.js\n**File:** `app/src/logic/rules/proposals/proposalButtonRules.js`\n**Line:** 1\n**Issue:** The file imports from `'../../../config/proposalStatusConfig.js'` which doesn't exist. The correct import should be from `'../../constants/proposalStatuses.js'`.\n**Affected Pages:** /proposals (via useProposalButtonStates hook)\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\nimport { getStatusConfig, PROPOSAL_STATUS } from '../../../config/proposalStatusConfig.js';\n\n/**\n * Compute button states for a proposal card (pure function).\n * @param {object} params - Named parameters\n * @returns {object} Button states\n */\nexport function computeProposalButtonStates({ proposal, virtualMeeting, guest, listing, currentUserId }) {\n  // Uses PROPOSAL_STATUS which should be PROPOSAL_STATUSES\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\nimport { getStatusConfig, PROPOSAL_STATUSES } from '../../constants/proposalStatuses.js';\n\n// Alias for backward compatibility with existing code\nconst PROPOSAL_STATUS = {\n  REJECTED_BY_HOST: PROPOSAL_STATUSES.REJECTED_BY_HOST.key,\n  CANCELLED_BY_SPLITLEASE: PROPOSAL_STATUSES.CANCELLED_BY_SPLITLEASE.key,\n  CANCELLED_BY_GUEST: PROPOSAL_STATUSES.CANCELLED_BY_GUEST.key,\n  INITIAL_PAYMENT_LEASE_ACTIVATED: PROPOSAL_STATUSES.INITIAL_PAYMENT_SUBMITTED_LEASE_ACTIVATED.key,\n  PROPOSAL_SUBMITTED_BY_SL_AWAITING_APPLICATION: PROPOSAL_STATUSES.SUGGESTED_PROPOSAL_AWAITING_RENTAL_APP.key,\n  PROPOSAL_SUBMITTED_BY_SL_PENDING_CONFIRMATION: PROPOSAL_STATUSES.SUGGESTED_PROPOSAL_PENDING_CONFIRMATION.key,\n  LEASE_DOCUMENTS_SENT: PROPOSAL_STATUSES.LEASE_DOCUMENTS_SENT_FOR_REVIEW.key,\n  HOST_COUNTEROFFER: PROPOSAL_STATUSES.COUNTEROFFER_SUBMITTED_AWAITING_GUEST_REVIEW.key,\n};\n\n/**\n * Compute button states for a proposal card (pure function).\n * @param {object} params - Named parameters\n * @returns {object} Button states\n */\nexport function computeProposalButtonStates({ proposal, virtualMeeting, guest, listing, currentUserId }) {\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Verify useProposalButtonStates hook works after fix\n- [ ] Test proposal card buttons display correctly\n- [ ] Verify all button states map correctly to new status keys\n\n~~~~~\n\n## PAGE GROUP: /search, /favorite-listings, /listings (Chunks: 7)\n\n### CHUNK 7: Malformed JSDoc in isContiguousSelection.js\n**File:** `app/src/logic/calculators/scheduling/isContiguousSelection.js`\n**Line:** 5\n**Issue:** The JSDoc contains a broken reference to a deprecated file path instead of proper `@param` annotation. This causes documentation tools to fail.\n**Affected Pages:** /search, /favorite-listings (via schedule selector)\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n/**\n * Check if selected days form a contiguous block.\n * Handles week wrap-around cases (e.g., Fri-Mon).\n *\n * @.claude\\plans\\Deprecated\\Context\\Option Sets\\ZEP - Curation Parameters(OS).md {number[]} selectedDays - Array of day indices (0-6).\n * @returns {boolean} True if days are contiguous.\n */\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n/**\n * Check if selected days form a contiguous block.\n * Handles week wrap-around cases (e.g., Fri-Mon).\n *\n * @param {number[]} selectedDays - Array of day indices (0-6).\n * @returns {boolean} True if days are contiguous.\n */\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Run JSDoc generation to verify no errors\n- [ ] TypeScript/IDE should show proper intellisense\n\n~~~~~\n\n## PAGE GROUP: /account-profile, /host-proposals (Chunks: 8)\n\n### CHUNK 8: Empty processors/external directory\n**File:** `app/src/logic/processors/external/`\n**Line:** N/A (directory)\n**Issue:** The `processors/external/` directory exists but is empty.

The rules version is more robust with better validation and clearer documentation.\n**Affected Pages:** /search, /view-split-lease (via useScheduleSelectorLogicCore.js)\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n/**\n * Check if selected days form a contiguous block.\n * Handles week wrap-around cases (e.g., Fri-Mon).\n *\n * @.claude\\plans\\Deprecated\\Context\\Option Sets\\ZEP - Curation Parameters(OS).md {number[]} selectedDays - Array of day indices (0-6).\n * @returns {boolean} True if days are contiguous.\n */\nexport function isContiguousSelection(selectedDays) {\n  if (!selectedDays || selectedDays.length === 0) return false;\n  if (selectedDays.length === 1) return true;\n  if (selectedDays.length >= 6) return true;\n\n  const sorted = [...selectedDays].sort((a, b) => a - b);\n  const isStandardContiguous = sorted.every((day, i) => i === 0 || day === sorted[i - 1] + 1);\n  if (isStandardContiguous) return true;\n\n  // Wrap-around check\n  const hasZero = sorted.includes(0);\n  const hasSix = sorted.includes(6);\n  if (hasZero && hasSix) {\n    const allDays = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];\n    const notSelectedDays = allDays.filter(d => !sorted.includes(d));\n\n    const minNotSelected = Math.min(...notSelectedDays);\n    const maxNotSelected = Math.max(...notSelectedDays);\n\n    return notSelectedDays.length === (maxNotSelected - minNotSelected + 1);\n  }\n\n  return false;\n}\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// FILE SHOULD BE DELETED\n// Re-export from the canonical location for backward compatibility\nexport { isScheduleContiguous as isContiguousSelection } from '../../rules/scheduling/isScheduleContiguous.js';\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Verify useScheduleSelectorLogicCore.js still works after update\n- [ ] Run SearchPage to ensure schedule selection works\n- [ ] Test wrap-around day selection (Fri-Mon)\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 2: Consolidate calculateCheckInOutFromDays.js with calculateCheckInOutDays.js\n**File:** `app/src/logic/calculators/scheduling/calculateCheckInOutFromDays.js`\n**Line:** 1-41\n**Issue:** Two files do nearly identical work. `calculateCheckInOutFromDays` returns `{checkIn, checkOut}` while `calculateCheckInOutDays` returns `{checkInDay, checkOutDay, checkInName, checkOutName}`. The latter is more complete. Consumers need to be updated to use a unified API.\n**Affected Pages:** /search (SearchPage.jsx, CompactScheduleIndicator.jsx)\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n/**\n * Calculate check-in and check-out days from selected day indices\n * Handles wrap-around scenarios (e.g., Fri-Mon selection)\n *\n * @param {number[]} selectedDays - Array of day indices (0=Sun, 6=Sat)\n * @returns {{ checkIn: number, checkOut: number } | null}\n */\nexport function calculateCheckInOutFromDays(selectedDays) {\n  if (!selectedDays || selectedDays.length < 2) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  const sortedDays = [...selectedDays].sort((a, b) => a - b);\n  const hasSaturday = sortedDays.includes(6);\n  const hasSunday = sortedDays.includes(0);\n  const isWrapAround = hasSaturday && hasSunday && sortedDays.length < 7;\n\n  if (isWrapAround) {\n    // Find the gap to determine actual boundaries\n    let gapIndex = -1;\n    for (let i = 1; i < sortedDays.length; i++) {\n      if (sortedDays[i] - sortedDays[i - 1] > 1) {\n        gapIndex = i;\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n\n    if (gapIndex !== -1) {\n      return {\n        checkIn: sortedDays[gapIndex],\n        checkOut: sortedDays[gapIndex - 1]\n      };\n    }\n  }\n\n  return {\n    checkIn: sortedDays[0],\n    checkOut: sortedDays[sortedDays.length - 1]\n  };\n}\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\nimport { calculateCheckInOutDays } from './calculateCheckInOutDays.js';\n\n/**\n * Calculate check-in and check-out days from selected day indices.\n *\n * @deprecated Use calculateCheckInOutDays instead for full details including day names.\n * This wrapper exists for backward compatibility with components expecting simplified output.\n *\n * @param {number[]} selectedDays - Array of day indices (0=Sun, 6=Sat)\n * @returns {{ checkIn: number, checkOut: number } | null}\n */\nexport function calculateCheckInOutFromDays(selectedDays) {\n  if (!selectedDays || selectedDays.length < 2) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  try {\n    const result = calculateCheckInOutDays({ selectedDays });\n    return {\n      checkIn: result.checkInDay,\n      checkOut: result.checkOutDay\n    };\n  } catch {\n    return null;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Verify SearchPage.jsx still works\n- [ ] Verify CompactScheduleIndicator.jsx still works\n- [ ] Test wrap-around selection (Fri-Mon)\n\n~~~~~\n\n## PAGE GROUP: /proposals, /view-split-lease (Chunks: 3, 4, 5, 6)\n\n### CHUNK 3: Remove duplicate processors/proposal/processProposalData.js\n**File:** `app/src/logic/processors/proposal/processProposalData.js`\n**Line:** 1-148\n**Issue:** This file exists BOTH at `processors/proposal/processProposalData.js` AND `processors/proposals/processProposalData.js`. The plural version (`proposals/`) has more functions (formatPrice, formatDate, getEffectiveTerms). The singular version has different field mapping. This creates confusion about which to import.\n**Affected Pages:** /proposals, /view-split-lease (via loadProposalDetailsWorkflow.js)\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n// processors/proposal/processProposalData.js (singular)\nimport { PROPOSAL_STATUSES, getUsualOrder } from '../../constants/proposalStatuses.js'\n\nexport function processProposalData({ rawProposal, listing = null, guest = null, host = null }) {\n  // ... 148 lines of proposal processing\n  // Uses different field names: 'Move-In Date', 'Days of Week', etc.\n  // Returns: id, listingId, guestId, status, deleted, usualOrder, currentTerms, originalTerms, hasCounteroffer, ...\n}\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// FILE SHOULD BE DELETED\n// The canonical location is processors/proposals/processProposalData.js (plural)\n// Re-export for backward compatibility\nexport { processProposalData } from '../proposals/processProposalData.js';\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Verify all imports still resolve\n- [ ] Run loadProposalDetailsWorkflow to ensure data loads correctly\n- [ ] Test proposal display on /proposals page\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 4: Remove duplicate workflows/booking/cancelProposalWorkflow.js\n**File:** `app/src/logic/workflows/booking/cancelProposalWorkflow.js`\n**Line:** 1-143\n**Issue:** This file exists BOTH at `workflows/booking/cancelProposalWorkflow.js` AND `workflows/proposals/cancelProposalWorkflow.js`. The `proposals/` version is imported by actual components (ProposalCard.jsx, ExpandableProposalCard.jsx, GuestEditingProposalModal.jsx). The `booking/` version appears unused but has different implementation.\n**Affected Pages:** /proposals (indirectly - currently unused)\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n// workflows/booking/cancelProposalWorkflow.js\nimport { PROPOSAL_STATUSES } from '../../constants/proposalStatuses.js'\n\nexport async function cancelProposalWorkflow({\n  supabase,\n  proposal,\n  source = 'main',\n  canCancelProposal\n}) {\n  // Different signature: takes supabase client and canCancelProposal function as params\n  // Implements 7-variation decision tree\n}\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// FILE SHOULD BE DELETED\n// The canonical location is workflows/proposals/cancelProposalWorkflow.js\n// Re-export for backward compatibility\nexport {\n  executeCancelProposal as cancelProposalWorkflow,\n  determineCancellationCondition,\n  cancelProposalFromCompareTerms,\n  executeDeleteProposal\n} from '../proposals/cancelProposalWorkflow.js';\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Search codebase for imports of workflows/booking/cancelProposalWorkflow\n- [ ] If no direct imports found, file can be safely deleted\n- [ ] Run cancel flow on proposal to verify it still works\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 5: Consolidate duplicate canCancelProposal implementations\n**File:** `app/src/logic/rules/proposals/canCancelProposal.js`\n**Line:** 1-47\n**Issue:** `canCancelProposal` is defined BOTH in `rules/proposals/canCancelProposal.js` (standalone file) AND inside `rules/proposals/proposalRules.js` (line 26-54). They have different signatures and slightly different logic.\n**Affected Pages:** /proposals, /view-split-lease\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n// rules/proposals/canCancelProposal.js (standalone)\nimport { isTerminalStatus, isCompletedStatus } from '../../constants/proposalStatuses.js'\n\nexport function canCancelProposal({ proposalStatus, deleted = false }) {\n  // Takes object with proposalStatus and deleted\n  // Returns boolean\n  if (deleted) return false;\n  if (!proposalStatus || typeof proposalStatus !== 'string') return false;\n  const status = proposalStatus.trim();\n  if (isTerminalStatus(status) || isCompletedStatus(status)) return false;\n  return true;\n}\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// FILE SHOULD BE DELETED\n// Re-export from proposalRules.js for backward compatibility\n// Note: proposalRules.canCancelProposal takes {proposal} not {proposalStatus, deleted}\n// We need to create a wrapper\n\nimport { canCancelProposal as canCancelProposalFromRules } from './proposalRules.js';\n\n/**\n * Wrapper for backward compatibility with code expecting the old signature.\n * @deprecated Import canCancelProposal from proposalRules.js and pass full proposal object.\n */\nexport function canCancelProposal({ proposalStatus, deleted = false }) {\n  // Create minimal proposal object for the rules function\n  return canCancelProposalFromRules({\n    status: proposalStatus,\n    Status: proposalStatus,\n    deleted\n  });\n}\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Find all imports of rules/proposals/canCancelProposal.js\n- [ ] Verify each consumer still works with the wrapper\n- [ ] Consider migrating consumers to use proposalRules.js directly\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 6: Fix broken import in proposalButtonRules.js\n**File:** `app/src/logic/rules/proposals/proposalButtonRules.js`\n**Line:** 1\n**Issue:** The file imports from `'../../../config/proposalStatusConfig.js'` which doesn't exist. The correct import should be from `'../../constants/proposalStatuses.js'`.\n**Affected Pages:** /proposals (via useProposalButtonStates hook)\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\nimport { getStatusConfig, PROPOSAL_STATUS } from '../../../config/proposalStatusConfig.js';\n\n/**\n * Compute button states for a proposal card (pure function).\n * @param {object} params - Named parameters\n * @returns {object} Button states\n */\nexport function computeProposalButtonStates({ proposal, virtualMeeting, guest, listing, currentUserId }) {\n  // Uses PROPOSAL_STATUS which should be PROPOSAL_STATUSES\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\nimport { getStatusConfig, PROPOSAL_STATUSES } from '../../constants/proposalStatuses.js';\n\n// Alias for backward compatibility with existing code\nconst PROPOSAL_STATUS = {\n  REJECTED_BY_HOST: PROPOSAL_STATUSES.REJECTED_BY_HOST.key,\n  CANCELLED_BY_SPLITLEASE: PROPOSAL_STATUSES.CANCELLED_BY_SPLITLEASE.key,\n  CANCELLED_BY_GUEST: PROPOSAL_STATUSES.CANCELLED_BY_GUEST.key,\n  INITIAL_PAYMENT_LEASE_ACTIVATED: PROPOSAL_STATUSES.INITIAL_PAYMENT_SUBMITTED_LEASE_ACTIVATED.key,\n  PROPOSAL_SUBMITTED_BY_SL_AWAITING_APPLICATION: PROPOSAL_STATUSES.SUGGESTED_PROPOSAL_AWAITING_RENTAL_APP.key,\n  PROPOSAL_SUBMITTED_BY_SL_PENDING_CONFIRMATION: PROPOSAL_STATUSES.SUGGESTED_PROPOSAL_PENDING_CONFIRMATION.key,\n  LEASE_DOCUMENTS_SENT: PROPOSAL_STATUSES.LEASE_DOCUMENTS_SENT_FOR_REVIEW.key,\n  HOST_COUNTEROFFER: PROPOSAL_STATUSES.COUNTEROFFER_SUBMITTED_AWAITING_GUEST_REVIEW.key,\n};\n\n/**\n * Compute button states for a proposal card (pure function).\n * @param {object} params - Named parameters\n * @returns {object} Button states\n */\nexport function computeProposalButtonStates({ proposal, virtualMeeting, guest, listing, currentUserId }) {\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Verify useProposalButtonStates hook works after fix\n- [ ] Test proposal card buttons display correctly\n- [ ] Verify all button states map correctly to new status keys\n\n~~~~~\n\n## PAGE GROUP: /search, /favorite-listings, /listings (Chunks: 7)\n\n### CHUNK 7: Malformed JSDoc in isContiguousSelection.js\n**File:** `app/src/logic/calculators/scheduling/isContiguousSelection.js`\n**Line:** 5\n**Issue:** The JSDoc contains a broken reference to a deprecated file path instead of proper `@param` annotation. This causes documentation tools to fail.\n**Affected Pages:** /search, /favorite-listings (via schedule selector)\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n/**\n * Check if selected days form a contiguous block.\n * Handles week wrap-around cases (e.g., Fri-Mon).\n *\n * @.claude\\plans\\Deprecated\\Context\\Option Sets\\ZEP - Curation Parameters(OS).md {number[]} selectedDays - Array of day indices (0-6).\n * @returns {boolean} True if days are contiguous.\n */\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n/**\n * Check if selected days form a contiguous block.\n * Handles week wrap-around cases (e.g., Fri-Mon).\n *\n * @param {number[]} selectedDays - Array of day indices (0-6).\n * @returns {boolean} True if days are contiguous.\n */\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Run JSDoc generation to verify no errors\n- [ ] TypeScript/IDE should show proper intellisense\n\n~~~~~\n\n## PAGE GROUP: /account-profile, /host-proposals (Chunks: 8)\n\n### CHUNK 8: Empty processors/external directory\n**File:** `app/src/logic/processors/external/`\n**Line:** N/A (directory)\n**Issue:** The `processors/external/` directory exists but is empty. Documentation in `app/src/CLAUDE.md` references `adaptDaysFromBubble` and `adaptDaysToBubble` that should be in this directory but don't exist. Either create the files or remove the directory.\n**Affected Pages:** N/A (documentation consistency)\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n// Directory exists but is empty\n// CLAUDE.md references:\n// import { adaptDaysFromBubble } from 'logic/processors/external/adaptDaysFromBubble.js';\n// import { adaptDaysToBubble } from 'logic/processors/external/adaptDaysToBubble.js';\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// Option A: Remove empty directory and update CLAUDE.md\n// OR\n// Option B: Create placeholder files with proper exports\n\n// If Option B, create adaptDaysFromBubble.js:\n/**\n * Adapt day indices from Bubble.io format to internal format.\n * Note: As of 2025, database stores days natively in 0-indexed format.\n * This function exists for historical compatibility.\n * @param {number[]} bubbleDays - Day indices from Bubble (already 0-indexed)\n * @returns {number[]} Day indices in internal format (same as input)\n */\nexport function adaptDaysFromBubble(bubbleDays) {\n  return bubbleDays; // No-op: formats now match\n}\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Decide which option to implement\n- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md documentation if removing\n- [ ] Verify no code imports these non-existent files\n\n~~~~~\n\n## PAGE GROUP: /reminders (Chunks: 9)\n\n### CHUNK 9: Potential null pointer in reminderScheduling.js\n**File:** `app/src/logic/rules/reminders/reminderScheduling.js`\n**Line:** 1-50 (estimate)\n**Issue:** Need to verify error handling when reminder data is malformed.

Need to standardize. Files to review:\n- `processUserData.js` - throws\n- `processListingData` (in proposals/processProposalData.js) - returns null\n- `calculateCheckInOutFromDays.js` - returns null\n- `calculateCheckInOutDays.js` - throws\n**Affected Pages:** All (architectural consistency)\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n// Pattern A: Throws (preferred per CLAUDE.md)\nexport function processUserData(rawUser) {\n  if (!rawUser) {\n    throw new Error('processUserData: User data is required');\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n\n// Pattern B: Returns null (inconsistent)\nexport function processListingData(rawListing) {\n  if (!rawListing) {\n    return null;\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// Standardize on throwing for required data (Pattern A)\n// Keep null returns only for genuinely optional data\n\nexport function processListingData(rawListing) {\n  if (!rawListing) {\n    throw new Error('processListingData: Listing data is required');\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Audit all processor files for consistency\n- [ ] Update callers to handle throws instead of null checks\n- [ ] Document which functions can return null vs throw\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 12: Remove unused proposalStages.js constant file\n**File:** `app/src/logic/constants/proposalStages.js`\n**Line:** 1-50 (estimate)\n**Issue:** This file likely duplicates stage information already in `proposalStatuses.js`.
