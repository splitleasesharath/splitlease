Audit the codebase at: ../../app/src/logic

## Dependency Impact Analysis
Files: 0 | Edge reduction: 0%

### CRITICAL IMPACT (30+ dependents) - Avoid modifying
| File | Dependents |
|------|------------|

### HIGH IMPACT (15-29 dependents) - Change with caution
No files in this tier

### CIRCULAR IMPORTS
No circular dependencies detected

### LEAF FILES (safe to refactor): 0 files
### TOPOLOGICAL LEVELS: 0 levels

## Refactoring Guidelines Based on Dependencies
- Files marked CRITICAL (30+ dependents) should NOT be modified unless absolutely necessary
- Prefer modifying leaf files (0 dependents) when possible
- Files in CIRCULAR IMPORTS must be refactored together as a single atomic unit
- Follow topological levels: Level 0 first, then Level 1, etc.
- For HIGH impact files, ensure all dependent files are updated in the same batch

**Your Task:**

1. **Scan all files** in ../../app/src/logic recursively.
2. **Identify issues:** performance, maintainability, duplication, anti-patterns, or specifically general issues.
3. **For each issue, determine affected pages:**
   - Trace imports and usage to find which UI pages are affected by this code.
   - List page URLs (e.g., "/search, /view-split-lease").
   - If it's a shared utility or logic, identify all entry points.
   - If uncertain, use "AUTO".

4. **Create a chunk-based refactoring plan** at: .claude/plans/New/20260120070601_code_refactor_plan.md

**CRITICAL: Group chunks by affected page group.**

Structure:
# Code Refactoring Plan - ../../app/src/logic

Date: 2026-01-20
Audit Type: general

~~~~~

## PAGE GROUP: /search (Chunks: 1, 3)

### CHUNK 1: [Brief description]
**File:** [path]
**Line:** [line]
**Issue:** [description]
**Affected Pages:** /search

**Current Code:**
```javascript
[exact code]
```

**Refactored Code:**
```javascript
[refactored code]
```

**Testing:**
- [ ] [step]

~~~~~

### CHUNK 3: [Brief description]
...

~~~~~

## PAGE GROUP: /view-split-lease (Chunks: 2)
...

**CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:**
1. **Group by PAGE GROUP** header.
2. **One chunk = one atomic fix**.
3. **Use horizontal rules (EXACTLY `~~~~~`)** to separate chunks.
4. **MANDATORY: Each chunk MUST have TWO complete code blocks (Current vs Refactored)**.
5. **Line numbers must be accurate**.
6. **Include affected pages in EACH chunk metadata**.

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS

You MUST format each chunk exactly as follows:

```
## Chunk N of M
- **Files**: `path/to/file1.js`, `path/to/file2.js`
- **Rationale**: Why these files are grouped together
- **Approach**: How to refactor them
```

IMPORTANT:
- Use exact file paths from the codebase (shown in dependency analysis above)
- Each file path MUST be wrapped in backticks
- Files in CIRCULAR IMPORTS must be in the SAME chunk
- Do NOT include files not mentioned in the dependency analysis
