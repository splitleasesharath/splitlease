The `booking/` version is simpler and takes rule functions as parameters. The `proposals/` version imports rules directly and has more complex decision logic. This creates confusion about which to use.\n**Affected Pages:** /guest-proposals, /proposals\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n// workflows/booking/cancelProposalWorkflow.js (67 lines)\n// - Takes canCancelProposal as a parameter\n// - Simpler decision tree\n// - Used in: (appears to be unused based on grep)\n\n// workflows/proposals/cancelProposalWorkflow.js (176 lines)\n// - Imports rules directly from proposalRules.js\n// - Has 7 workflow variations mapped to Bubble.io\n// - Used in: GuestEditingProposalModal.jsx, ExpandableProposalCard.jsx, ProposalCard.jsx\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// DECISION: Keep workflows/proposals/cancelProposalWorkflow.js as the canonical version\n// REASON: It has full Bubble.io workflow mapping and is actively used\n\n// ACTION 1: Delete workflows/booking/cancelProposalWorkflow.js (unused)\n\n// ACTION 2: Update imports if any code references the booking version\n// (None found in grep search - safe to delete)\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Verify no imports reference `workflows/booking/cancelProposalWorkflow.js`\n- [ ] Test cancel proposal flow on /guest-proposals page\n- [ ] Test delete proposal flow for terminal-state proposals\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 3: Consolidate duplicate processProposalData files\n**Files:** `processors/proposal/processProposalData.js`, `processors/proposals/processProposalData.js`\n**Line:** N/A (entire files)\n**Issue:** Two `processProposalData.js` files exist in different directories (`proposal/` singular vs `proposals/` plural). This naming inconsistency can cause import confusion and maintenance issues.\n**Affected Pages:** /guest-proposals, /proposals, /view-split-lease\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n// processors/proposal/processProposalData.js\n// - Contains the actual implementation\n// - Referenced in loadProposalDetailsWorkflow.js JSDoc example\n\n// processors/proposals/processProposalData.js\n// - Duplicate/alternate version\n// - Listed in git status as modified\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// DECISION: Keep processors/proposals/processProposalData.js (plural, matches directory convention)\n// REASON: Other processor directories use plural form (e.g., reminders/, reviews/)\n\n// ACTION 1: Compare both files for differences\n// ACTION 2: Merge any unique functionality into proposals/processProposalData.js\n// ACTION 3: Delete processors/proposal/ directory entirely\n// ACTION 4: Update any imports pointing to proposal/ to use proposals/\n\n// Update in loadProposalDetailsWorkflow.js JSDoc:\n// FROM: import { processProposalData } from '../logic/processors/proposal/processProposalData.js'\n// TO:   import { processProposalData } from '../logic/processors/proposals/processProposalData.js'\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Compare both files for differences before merge\n- [ ] Update all imports after consolidation\n- [ ] Test proposal loading on /view-split-lease page\n- [ ] Test proposal list display on /guest-proposals page\n\n~~~~~\n\n### CHUNK 4: Consolidate duplicate contiguous selection logic\n**Files:** `calculators/scheduling/isContiguousSelection.js`, `rules/scheduling/isScheduleContiguous.js`\n**Line:** N/A (entire files)\n**Issue:** Two functions implementing the same contiguous day selection logic:\n- `isContiguousSelection()` in calculators (31 lines, simpler)\n- `isScheduleContiguous()` in rules (108 lines, more documented)\n\nThe rules version has better documentation, validation, and follows the named parameter pattern. The calculator version is legacy.\n**Affected Pages:** /search, /view-split-lease, /create-proposal\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n// calculators/scheduling/isContiguousSelection.js (31 lines)\nexport function isContiguousSelection(selectedDays) {\n  if (!selectedDays || selectedDays.length === 0) return false;\n  // ... simpler implementation, positional parameters\n}\n\n// rules/scheduling/isScheduleContiguous.js (108 lines)\nexport function isScheduleContiguous({ selectedDayIndices }) {\n  // ... named parameters, full validation, better documentation\n}\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// DECISION: Keep rules/scheduling/isScheduleContiguous.js as canonical\n// REASON: Better documentation, validation, follows project conventions\n\n// ACTION 1: Create backward-compatible wrapper in calculators/\n// calculators/scheduling/isContiguousSelection.js:\nimport { isScheduleContiguous } from '../../rules/scheduling/isScheduleContiguous.js';\n\n/**\n * @deprecated Use isScheduleContiguous from rules/scheduling instead\n * Kept for backward compatibility with existing imports\n */\nexport function isContiguousSelection(selectedDays) {\n  if (!selectedDays) return false;\n  return isScheduleContiguous({ selectedDayIndices: selectedDays });\n}\n\n// ACTION 2: Update lib/availabilityValidation.js to use isScheduleContiguous\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Update availabilityValidation.js to use new import\n- [ ] Test schedule selection on /view-split-lease page\n- [ ] Test proposal creation schedule validation\n\n~~~~~\n\n## PAGE GROUP: /search (Chunks: 5)\n\n### CHUNK 5: Extract hardcoded DAY_NAMES constant\n**Files:** `workflows/scheduling/validateMoveInDateWorkflow.js`, `workflows/scheduling/validateScheduleWorkflow.js`\n**Line:** 105, 99\n**Issue:** `DAY_NAMES` array is defined inline in multiple files instead of being imported from a shared constant. This violates DRY and creates maintenance burden if day names need to change.\n**Affected Pages:** /search, /view-split-lease, /create-proposal\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n// validateMoveInDateWorkflow.js:105\nconst DAY_NAMES = ['Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday']\n\n// validateScheduleWorkflow.js:99\nconst DAY_NAMES = ['Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday']\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n// NEW FILE: constants/schedulingConstants.js\n/**\n * Day name constants for scheduling logic.\n * Index 0 = Sunday (matches JavaScript Date.getDay())\n */\nexport const DAY_NAMES = [\n  'Sunday',\n  'Monday',\n  'Tuesday',\n  'Wednesday',\n  'Thursday',\n  'Friday',\n  'Saturday'\n];\n\n// Abbreviated day names for compact UI display\nexport const DAY_ABBREVIATIONS = ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat'];\n\n// In validateMoveInDateWorkflow.js and validateScheduleWorkflow.js:\nimport { DAY_NAMES } from '../../constants/schedulingConstants.js';\n// Remove local const declaration\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Create constants/schedulingConstants.js\n- [ ] Update both workflow files to import DAY_NAMES\n- [ ] Verify date display on /search page calendar\n- [ ] Verify move-in date validation messages\n\n~~~~~\n\n## PAGE GROUP: /house-manual, /reminders (Chunks: 6)\n\n### CHUNK 6: Fix malformed JSDoc in isContiguousSelection.js\n**File:** `calculators/scheduling/isContiguousSelection.js`\n**Line:** 5\n**Issue:** JSDoc @param annotation contains corrupted file path reference instead of proper type annotation: `@.claude\\plans\\Deprecated\\Context\\Option Sets\\ZEP - Curation Parameters(OS).md {number[]}`\n**Affected Pages:** AUTO (affects JSDoc tooling and documentation generation)\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\n/**\n * Check if selected days form a contiguous block.\n * Handles week wrap-around cases (e.g., Fri-Mon).\n *\n * @.claude\\plans\\Deprecated\\Context\\Option Sets\\ZEP - Curation Parameters(OS).md {number[]} selectedDays - Array of day indices (0-6).\n * @returns {boolean} True if days are contiguous.\n */\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\n/**\n * Check if selected days form a contiguous block.\n * Handles week wrap-around cases (e.g., Fri-Mon).\n *\n * @param {number[]} selectedDays - Array of day indices (0-6).\n * @returns {boolean} True if days are contiguous.\n *\n * @deprecated Use isScheduleContiguous from rules/scheduling instead\n */\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Fix the JSDoc annotation\n- [ ] Run linter to verify JSDoc is valid\n- [ ] Verify IDE intellisense shows correct parameter info\n\n~~~~~\n\n## PAGE GROUP: /view-split-lease (Chunks: 7)\n\n### CHUNK 7: Simplify reviewAdapter.js duplicate REVIEW_CATEGORIES lookup\n**File:** `processors/reviews/reviewAdapter.js`\n**Line:** 81-84\n**Issue:** In `adaptReviewFromApi`, REVIEW_CATEGORIES.find() is called twice for each rating - once for title and once for question. This is inefficient and should use a single lookup.\n**Affected Pages:** /view-split-lease, /reviews\n\n**Current Code:**\n```javascript\nratings: (apiReview.ratings || []).map(r => ({\n  categoryId: r.category_id,\n  title: REVIEW_CATEGORIES.find(c => c.id === r.category_id)?.title || r.category_id,\n  question: REVIEW_CATEGORIES.find(c => c.id === r.category_id)?.question || '',\n  value: r.value\n})),\n```\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```javascript\nratings: (apiReview.ratings || []).map(r => {\n  const category = REVIEW_CATEGORIES.find(c => c.id === r.category_id);\n  return {\n    categoryId: r.category_id,\n    title: category?.title || r.category_id,\n    question: category?.question || '',\n    value: r.value\n  };\n}),\n```\n\n**Testing:**\n- [ ] Test review display on listing detail page\n- [ ] Verify all 12 review categories render correctly\n\n~~~~~\n\n## PAGE GROUP: /guest-proposals (Chunks: 8)\n\n### CHUNK 8: Remove redundant trim() in canAcceptProposal.js\n**File:** `rules/proposals/canAcceptProposal.js`\n**Line:** 42\n**Issue:** The status is already trimmed on line 38, but PROPOSAL_STATUSES.COUNTEROFFER_SUBMITTED_AWAITING_GUEST_REVIEW.key is also trimmed.
