## Instructions:
1. Analyze the build errors to understand what went wrong
2. Read the affected files to see the current state
3. Fix the errors - common issues include:
   - Import path errors (file doesn't exist, wrong relative path)
   - Missing exports (function was deleted but still imported elsewhere)
   - Circular dependencies
   - Syntax errors from incomplete edits
4. After making fixes, verify by checking the file syntax
5. DO NOT add new features or refactor further - only fix the build errors

Focus on making the build pass. Be surgical - fix only what's broken.
