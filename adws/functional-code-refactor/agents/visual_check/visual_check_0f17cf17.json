First, determine the correct URL path for the host proposals page (likely something like /host-proposals or /proposals/host)\n2. Navigate to LIVE: https://split.lease/[correct-path]\n3. Wait 2 seconds for page load\n4. Take full-page screenshot of LIVE\n5. Navigate to DEV: http://localhost:8010/[correct-path]\n6. Wait 2 seconds for page load\n7. Take full-page screenshot of DEV\n8. Capture console errors from both environments\n9. Compare the screenshots visually\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Use the appropriate Playwright MCP session (likely playwright-host-live and playwright-host-dev based on the context)\n- Ignore pixel-perfect differences and different data values\n- Focus on layout structure, interactive elements, and content rendering\n- Capture any console errors\n\n**Return format:**\nProvide a JSON object with:\n{\n  \"visualParity\": \"PASS\" | \"FAIL\",\n  \"issues\": [\"list of visual differences\"],\n  \"consoleErrors\": [\"list of console errors from both envs\"],\n  \"explanation\": \"Brief reasoning for the verdict\"\n}\n\nNote: If you need to determine the correct route, you can reference the routes.config.js file or check common host proposal page patterns in the codebase."
