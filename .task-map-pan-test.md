# Task: Test Map Panning Functionality with Playwright MCP

## Context
Testing the map panning functionality on a split lease listing page to verify that the recent fix properly centers the map vertically when the "Located in..." link is clicked.

## Requirements
Use Playwright MCP to perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5174/view-split-lease.html?id=1586447992720x748691103167545300`
2. Wait for the page to fully load - specifically wait for the listing content to appear
3. Take a screenshot of the full listing page and save it as: `C:/Users/Split Lease/splitleaseteam/!Agent Context and Tools/SL6/Split Lease/listing_before_pan.png`
4. Scroll down to locate the map section
5. Click on the "Located in..." link/text element to trigger the map panning animation
6. Wait 2 seconds for the pan animation to complete
7. Take a screenshot showing the map section after panning and save it as: `C:/Users/Split Lease/splitleaseteam/!Agent Context and Tools/SL6/Split Lease/map_after_pan.png`
8. Close the browser properly when done

## Success Criteria
- Both screenshots are captured successfully
- The map panning animation is triggered
- Screenshots show the before and after states clearly
- Browser is closed properly to prevent resource leaks

## Expected Output
Return the absolute paths to both screenshots:
- listing_before_pan.png
- map_after_pan.png
